<p>
I've been using Unix systems since about 1990, cutting my teeth on 4.2BSD
on a VAX, 4.3BSD on HP 9000/300s, and early versions of HP-UX, SunOS,
and Dynix.  I started using NetBSD when
<a href="../../releases/formal-0.8/">NetBSD 0.8</a> was released.

<p>
While a student at Oregon State University, I worked for the
Computer Science Department as a systems administrator and research
programmer.  The Department, being near Hewlett-Packard's largest
campus, had quite a supply of HP 9000/300-series systems.  Just after
the <a href="../../releases/formal-0.9/">NetBSD 0.9</a> release, I
began using these systems to hack on
<a href="../../Ports/hp300/">NetBSD/hp300</a>.

<p>
I left the University in December 1994 and joined the Numerical
Aerospace Simulation Facility at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain
View, CA as a research programmer in January 1995.  While there, I
worked on many parts of the NetBSD operating system, including the
network stack, virtual memory subsystem, network device drivers, the
SCSI subsystem, toolchain, and the
<a href="../../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a> port.  Much of this
work was in support of a mass storage R&amp;D project utilizing large
AlphaServer systems, disk arrays, and tape silos.

<p>
In March 2000, I left NASA and joined Zembu Labs, Inc., a startup
company located in Palo Alto, CA, as a senior systems engineer.
Zembu did distributed application infrastructure software.  The core
was formed by Zembu's distributed database software.  I worked on
Zembu's distributed infrastructure management software.  Zembu is no
more, but
<a href="http://www.airs.com/ian/">Ian Lance Taylor</a> (one of the
founders of Zembu) acquired all of the Zembu IP and is planning on making
it open source.

<p>
In August 2001, I moved on once again and joined Wasabi Systems, Inc.

<p>
In January 2005, I left Wasabi to join
<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Computer</a>.

<p>
While I no longer work on NetBSD as part of my regular job, I still find
time to tinker with it.  My main NetBSD interests these days are related
to making the system more dynamically extensible as well as integrated
directory services.

<p>
When I'm not sitting in front of a computer screen, I like to cook,
go to the gym, ride my bike, play San Francisco city league softball,
work on the house and
<a href="http://www.shagadelic.org/pod/">my Volkswagen</a>, and reward
myself for all of my hard work by going to see the San Francisco Giants
race to win the NL West.

<p>
I live in San Francisco with my wonderful wife Heather and our
three cats: Mips, Flops, and Emma.
