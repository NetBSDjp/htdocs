<para>
If the NetBSD Project were a large company, the NetBSD core group would
be the technical management.
</para>

<para>
No, it's not just dead weight.  Rather, members of the core group
set the direction and goals of the NetBSD Project as a whole,
promote people's interest in the NetBSD Project and the system it
produces, and consider the serious architectural questions that need to
be addressed if the NetBSD Project is going to keep producing a viable
system.

      He started using 4.2BSD in 1984 at DEC.  In 1988, after 5 years at DEC
      supporting ULTRIX, he transferred to NAC (Networks And Communications).
      While there, he maintained various pieces of DECnet, DECnet/OSI, and
      the base O/S for ULTRIX and Tru64 (DEC OSF/1).  He also worked on an
      IPv6 prototype for Tru64.  While at DEC he also wrote and supported many
      device drivers for DEC network adapters for NetBSD.  He left DEC in 1998.
      </para>
      <para>
      His major contributions to NetBSD include the initial &man.elf.5;
      support, FDDI,
      VAX toolchain work (&man.a.out.5; shared libraries followed by
      &man.elf.5; support),
      PowerPC machine support, Netwinder support, and networking improvements.
      </para>
      <para>
      For the past several years, his work has been focused on adapting
      NetBSD to the embedded systems of his employers, Allegro Networks, and
      currently, <ulink url="http://www.brocade.com/">Brocade Communications</ulink>.

      He first encountered Unix in 1987 - it was DEMOS 2.0, a Soviet 2.9BSD
      derivative.  Incidentally, "M" in DEMOS stands for "portable", so one
      can say that his fate was predetermined back then.
      </para>
      <para>
      His NetBSD activities are mostly related to SuperH and SPARC ports.
