<para>
A large number of people have put a lot of time and effort into making
the NetBSD operating system what it is today, either by developing the
system itself, supporting its development, or simply using it.
Those people can be broken down into the following groups:

<para>
Additionally, without the University of California, Berkeley's
<ulink url="CSRG-contrib.html">Computer Systems Research Group and the
many contributors to the Berkeley Software Distributions</ulink>,
the NetBSD Project surely would not exist.  We thank them for
their efforts.
