<para>
The NetBSD port maintainers fix and improve the various ports of
NetBSD.  There is one port maintainer or a team of
two co-maintainers per type of machine that the
NetBSD operating system
supports.  A port's maintainer is the final authority about changes
being made to that port, and is responsible for attempting to fix
problems with the port and for integrating improvements into the port
in a timely manner.  If a port doesn't have a maintainer, then we
can't consider it ``supported.''  Being a port maintainer is hard work,
but is crucial to the NetBSD Project's continued success.
