<h1>Other Groups within the NetBSD Project</h1>

The page lists the other groups within NetBSD, their areas of responsibility,
and contact information.  These are in addition to:
<p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../supporting-cast.html">NetBSD Developers</a>
  <li><a href="../core.html">NetBSD Core Group</a>
  <li><a href="../board.html">NetBSD Foundation</a>
</ul>
<p>

Most <a href="../supporting-cast.html">NetBSD
Developers</a> aren't involved in any of these groups, but still benefit
and contribute substantially to the Project.  Without all of these
people, NetBSD wouldn't exist.
