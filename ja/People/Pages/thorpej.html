<p>
This is me in front of the Rio Grande Gorge in northern New Mexico, during
a camping trip with friends Lonnie, Yvonne, and Carolyn over the
Thanksgiving holiday in 1997.
</p>

<p>
I've been using NetBSD for quite a while (mid 1993).  I started with
<a href="../../Releases/formal-0.8/index.html">NetBSD 0.8</a>,
but I didn't really become heavily involved with NetBSD until
<a href="../../Releases/formal-0.9/index.html">NetBSD 0.9</a> was released.
Prior to NetBSD, my UNIX experience was with 4.2BSD on a VAX, 4.3BSD on
the HP 9000/300, and early versions of HP-UX, SunOS, and Dynix.
</p>

<p>
During the period between NetBSD 0.9 and NetBSD 1.0, I started hacking
on NetBSD/hp300.  At the time, I worked for, and was a student at,
<a href="http://www.orst.edu/">Oregon State University's</a>
<a href="http://www.cs.orst.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>.
The department had gobs HP 9000/300-series systems, and we were already
running Utah's 4.3BSD port on a bunch of these machines.
</p>

<p>
During the day I work for
<a href="http://www.arc.nasa.gov/">NASA Ames Research Center's</a>
<a href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/">Numerical Aerospace Simulation
Facility</a>,
where I am a Network Systems Engineer in the Local Area Networks Group.
I'm lucky enough to work on NetBSD as an integral part of my job; we are
using NetBSD as a platform for network research and development.  My
friend and co-worker Kevin Lahey (another NetBSD developer) and I spend a lot of
time working on the NetBSD network code, and are active participants in
the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>.
</p>

<p>
My two main NetBSD platforms are
<a href="../../Ports/alpha/index.html">NetBSD/alpha</a> and
<a href="../../Ports/i386/index.html">NetBSD/i386</a>.
In my lab and my tiny little office plot, I run a small cluster of NetBSD
systems, including a SPARC, a couple of Alphas, a couple of PCs, a DECstation,
a Power Macintosh, a couple of StrongARM Shark NCs, and a VAXstation.  I
also lug around an NEC Versa 6050MX laptop running NetBSD, and keep it
connected to the world with
<a href="http://www.ricochet.net/">Metricom Ricochet</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I have spare brain cycles, I also play port-master for
<a href="../../Ports/hp300/index.html">NetBSD/hp300</a>.  Hey, someone
has to, and I still use an HP 9000/380 as my router and main server at home.
</p>

<p>
I have lots of things that consume the time I don't spend working.  Several
of them are outdoor activities, so they depend on the season somewhat.
</p>

<p>
Spring time is when I bring out the mountain bike, give it a tune-up,
and start getting in shape for the summer biking season.
</p>

<p>
In the summer, I like to ride my bike in the beautiful preserves
around the San Francisco Bay Area.  I like to ride up in the City, too,
and shoot for a trip across the Golden Gate Bridge and up into the Marin
Headlands once a week.  Summertime also sees me strap on rollerblades (a
scary sight every afternoon!) and hiking boots.  You're likely to catch
me preparing for a camping trip around this time, as well.  I'm also
getting kayaking lessons from my friends Lonnie, Yvonne, and Randy.  I'll
get the hang of it one day.
</p>

<p>
I allocate the fall months to a bit more road riding; I like to get muddy,
but trail damage is a serious problem when it gets really wet.  (Are you
getting the feeling that I like to bicycle yet?)
</p>

<p>
Winter time is when I pretty much put the bike away, and dig the skis out.
I'm not really a down-hiller (I like the sensation of going down a hill
fast on a bike a lot more than on skis), but I recently got into cross-country
skiing.
</p>

<p>
When I'm not outdoors I like to play my
<a href="http://www.gibson.com/products/gibson/LesPaul/Standard.html">guitar</a>
and/or listen to music, see non-mainstream movies (I just love the
<a href="http://www.thecastro.com/">Castro Theater</a>), see live
music (it's not uncommon for me to somewhat impulsively travel to
Portland, OR, my sort-of home town, to see a favorite band), or
just drink beer and be merry with friends.
</p>

<p>
For kicks, you can check out
<a href="http://www.bayarea.net/~thorpej/freak-cam.html">FREAK-CAM</a>,
a little diversion I created to waste precious network bandwidth.
</p>

<p>
If you're ever in my neck of the woods (San Francisco Bay Area),
drop me a line.
