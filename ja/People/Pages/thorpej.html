<p>
I've been using Unix systems since about 1990, cutting my teeth on 4.2BSD
on a VAX, 4.3BSD on HP 9000/300s, and early versions of HP-UX, SunOS,
and Dynix.  I started using NetBSD when
<a href="../../Releases/formal-0.8/">NetBSD 0.8</a> was released.

<p>
While a student at Oregon State University, I worked for the
Computer Science Department as a systems administrator and research
programmer.  The Department, being near Hewlett-Packard's largest
campus, had quite a supply of HP 9000/300-series systems.  Just after
the <a href="../../Releases/formal-0.9/">NetBSD 0.9</a> release, I
began using these systems to hack on
<a href="../../Ports/hp300/">NetBSD/hp300</a>.

<p>
I left the University in December 1994 and joined the Numerical
Aerospace Simulation Facility at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain
View, CA as a research programmer in January 1995.  While there, I
worked on many parts of the NetBSD operating system, including the
network stack, virtual memory subsystem, network device drivers, the
SCSI subsystem, toolchain, and the
<a href="../../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a> port.  Much of this
work was in support of a mass storage R&amp;D project utilizing large
AlphaServer systems, disk arrays, and tape silos.

<p>
In March 2000, I left NASA and joined Zembu Labs, Inc., a startup
company located in Palo Alto, CA, as a senior systems engineer.
Zembu did distributed application infrastructure software.  The core
was formed by Zembu's distributed database software.  I worked on
Zembu's distributed infrastructure management software.  Zembu is no
more, but
<a href="http://www.airs.com/ian/">Ian Lance Taylor</a> (one of the
founders of Zembu) bought all of the Zembu IP and is planning on making
it open source.

<p>
In August 2001, I moved on once again and joined
<a href="http://www.wasabisystems.com/">Wasabi Systems, Inc.</a>,
an embedded systems software company that uses NetBSD as the core of
its products.

<p>
When I'm not at work, I like to hack on NetBSD on my rather large
collection of workstation-class computers.  At this point, I've hacked
on every platform NetBSD supports.  These days, my NetBSD interests
are mainly focused on embedded systems and multiprocessor support.  Though,
there's not many parts of the kernel that I don't enjoy working on.

<p>
When I'm not sitting in front of a computer screen, I like to cook,
make cocktails for friends, go to
<a href="http://www.phish.com/">Phish</a> shows, ride my mountain bike,
work on the house and
<a href="http://www.shagadelic.org/pod/">my Volkswagen</a>, and
reward myself for all that activity with a beer or two.

<p>
I live in San Francisco with my wonderful wife Heather and our
three cats: Mips, Flops, and Emma.
