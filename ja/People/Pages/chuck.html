<h1>About Chuck</h1>
I have been a BSD user since 1985 when I started college (using 4.2BSD).
Over the years I have progressed through 4.3BSD, MORE/bsd (from Mt. Xinu),
SunOS 4.x, and finally 4.4BSD.  I have been participating in the development 
of the free BSD operating systems (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD) since 1994.  
I have contributed sun4 support to the sparc port, integrated ATM networking 
into BSD, and written a replacement for the 4.4BSD virtual memory system 
(the UVM Virtual Memory System).   I was also the port-master for the NetBSD 
mvme68k port from July 1995 (when it was first imported into the source 
tree) until February 1999.  Recently I have been focusing my BSD-related 
hacking efforts on maintaining and upgrading UVM.<p>

I am currently a Senior Technical Staff Member in the Distributed Systems
Research department at 
<a href="http://www.research.att.com">AT&T Labs-Research</a> in Florham Park, 
New Jeresy (about an hour west of New York City).  Prior to joining AT&T
I was a Computer Science doctoral student at Washington University in 
St. Louis Missouri (I completed my D.Sc. in August 1998).  I also have
a masters degree in Computer Science from Washington University, and a 
Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree from University of Delaware (EG89).
