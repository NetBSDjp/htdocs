<h2>My involvement with the NetBSD Project</h2>

<p>
I came to NetBSD in late 1.1, about a month before 1.2 release.
It was time when I purchased my own computer and one of collegues
suggested trying out NetBSD. Decision to do so was one of major
positive movements in my life ;-)
<br>
I've become a developer on July 21st 1999.
</p>
<P>
I generally work on NTFS/MSDOSFS, Linux emulation support.
I'm also maintainer of 
<A HREF="../../Ports/i386/ps2.html">NetBSD on IBM PS/2</A>
and do other general kernel hacking occasionally.
Seems likely I'll be involved in RS/6000 and/or SGI Indy porting efford 
in future.<br>
Last but not least, I attempt to add various iso-8859-2/czech
language support things to NetBSD; those bits are quite limited
though, since I don't consider this as a primary priority.
<P>

<h2>And off the computer keyboard?</h2>

<P>
I live in the second biggest town of Czech Republic - Brno.
It's a nice city, has got rich cultural life and many work opportunities,
while not being too dense; it's a pleasant place to live
in.
</p>

<p>
Besides my wife and computer programming, I like &amp; enjoy biking, hiking, baseball, good
wine and (Italian) food.
</p>

<p>
I worked for <A HREF="http://www.ics.muni.cz/">Institute
of Computer Science of Masaryk university</A>
in the past while I was on the university, then for a year
and a half in small software company
<A HREF="http://www.per4mance.cz">Per4mance</A> (database, system
integration), then like a 3/4 year for
<A HREF="http://www.ibis.cz/">IBIS</A> (some e-commerce, database &amp;
web stuff, luckily can use NetBSD).
I prefer ~small software companies; I don't want to be just one
of countless anonymous wheels in big company machinery.

<p>
My "real" homepage is <A HREF="http://www.ics.muni.cz/~dolecek/">elsewhere</A>
(Czech only at the moment, sorry).
