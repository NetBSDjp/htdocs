<h2>My involvement with the NetBSD Project</h2>

<p>
I came to NetBSD in late 1.1, about a month before 1.2 release.
It was time when I purchased my own computer and one of collegues
suggested trying out NetBSD - and doing so was one of
my good decisions :)
<BR>
I've become a developer on July 21st 1999. I care of NTFS
(with general FS hacking from time to time). I'm also going
to actually integrate
<A HREF="../../../www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~st/netbsd-mca.html">Scott 
Telford's</A> and 
<A HREF="../../../www.sprc.qut.edu.au/~mcgarry/netbsd/mca.html">
McGarry's</A> MCA patches - the integration should happen
sometimes after
1.5 release.<BR>
I'd also like to see better support for iso-8859-2 and czech language
in general (sysinst, libc); however, that work
is rather low-priority one.
</P>

<P>
I live in Brno in Czech Republic. I like biking a lot
and some hiking from time to time.
</P>

<p>
I worked for <A HREF="../../../www.ics.muni.cz/index.html">Institute
of Computer Science of Masaryk university</A>
in the past while I was on the university. Now, I work
in small software company
<A HREF="../../../www.per4mance.cz">Per4mance</A>, some
DB staff involving Oracle 8i. I'd like to find a job where
I could do some more NetBSD hacking though *daydream* ;-)
</P>

My "real" homepage is <A HREF="../../../www.ics.muni.cz/~dolecek">elsewhere</A>
(Czech only at the moment, sorry).
