<h2>Scott Reynolds</h2>

<p><em>Image currently unavailable.</em></p>

<p>
I am currently  a member of the NetBSD core group, as well as the maintainer of
<a href="../../Ports/mac68k/index.html">NetBSD/mac68k</a>.
</p>

<h3>Things that I'm working on now, or intend to shortly:</h3>

<p><ul>
<li>Resolve Duo problems:  docked vs. undocked video, and two 5380-
    compatible SCSI controllers.  Create a `duo' bus for attaching
    SCSI, Ethernet, video, etc. on Duodocks.</li>
<li>Bring memory mapping in line with other 680x0-based ports as
    much as is practical, to ease maintenance.  This primarily means
    that I need to figure out how to disable the MMU early on.</li>
<li>Acquire significant SCSI clue and fix the machine-independent
    5380 driver so that it's reliable for MO, tapes, and other slow
    SCSI devices.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Things that other people have volunteered to do:</h3>

<p><ul>
<li>Work on a NetBSD-based install process.</li>
<li>Fix floating point emulation for the 68LC040-based machines.
    In particular, FMOVEM emulation is broken, and the Linux/68k
    fix is a gross hack.</li>
<li>Figure out more about the ASC and EASC audio chips.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>``When I have spare time:''</h3>

<p><ul>
<li>Add some missing ite emulation code, or better yet, replace
    grf/ite with fb/wscons.</li>
<li>Integrate color support, and define a common interface for both
    NuBus-based and internal video.  (This may not be feasible.)
</ul></p>
