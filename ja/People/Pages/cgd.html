<p>
Yes, I finally found a picture!
</p>

<p>
When this picture was taken, I was back-stage at Radio City Music Hall
preparing for the Oracle 8/Network Computer Launch, in June, 1997.
(People wielding cameras should not taunt busy hackers.)
</p>

<h2>My involvement with the NetBSD Project</h2>

<p>
I'm one of the founders of the NetBSD Project, and a former member
of the <a href="../core.html">NetBSD Core Group</a>.  (I resigned from
'core' in August, 1995.)
I was also the primary initial developer and
<a href="../port-maintainers.html">port maintainer</a> of the
<a href="../../Ports/alpha/index.html">NetBSD/alpha</a> port.
(I resigned from that position in August, 1997.)
</p>

<p>
I was the initial moderator of the
<a href="news:comp.unix.bsd.netbsd.announce">comp.unix.bsd.netbsd.announce
newsgroup</a> after its creation, but gave up that position when I resigned
from 'core'.  In April, 1998, I took over that position again because a new
moderator was sorely needed and no other volunteers could be found.
</p>

<p>
These days, my involvement in NetBSD is mostly limited to minor hacking
projects and question answering.  Recently I've not had much time to hack
on NetBSD.  When I have, it's mostly been on the
<a href="../../Ports/arm32/index.html">NetBSD/arm32</a> port, in
support of the
<a href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/iag/">Shark (Digital Network
Appliance Reference Design)</a>, on 
<a href="../../Ports/alpha/index.html">NetBSD/alpha</a>, or on
<a href="../../Ports/i386/index.html">NetBSD/i386</a>.
</p>

<h2>... but in real life ...</h2>

<p>
These days I'm doing information appliance device prototyping
at AT&T Labs in Menlo Park, California, and my hacking at work isn't
related to NetBSD.
</p>

<p>
In the past few years I've done NetBSD-related work at
<a href="http://www.digital.com/">Digital Equipment Corporation's</a>
<a href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/iag/">Internet Appliance
    Group</a> in Palo Alto, California, and
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science's</a>
<a href="http://www.pdl.cs.cmu.edu/">Parallel Data Lab</a>
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Those jobs had me spending
a significant amount of time hacking NetBSD, in addition to performing
other duties.
