<h1><a href="mailto:cgd@netbsd.org">Chris Demetriou</a></h1>

<p>
Yes, I finally found a picture!

<p>
When this picture was taken, I was back-stage at Radio City Music Hall
preparing for the Oracle 8/Network Computer Launch, in June, 1997.
(People wielding cameras should not taunt busy hackers.)
<p>

<h2>My involvement with the NetBSD Project</h2>

<p>
I'm one of the founders of the NetBSD Project, and a former member
of the <a href="../core.html">NetBSD Core Group</a>.  (I resigned from
'core' in August, 1995.)
I was also the primary initial developer and
<a href="../port-maintainers.html">port maintainer</a> of the
<a href="../../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a> port.
(I resigned from that position in August, 1997.)

<p>
I was the initial moderator of the
<a href="news:comp.unix.bsd.netbsd.announce">comp.unix.bsd.netbsd.announce
newsgroup</a> after its creation, but gave up that position when I resigned
from 'core'.  In April, 1998, I took over that position again because a new
moderator was sorely needed and no other volunteers could be found.

<p>
These days, my involvement in NetBSD is mostly limited to minor hacking
projects, answering peoples' questions, and providing advice and
historical perspective.
<p>

<h2>... but in real life ...</h2>

<p>
These days I'm working for
<a href="http://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom</a>.  (Broadcom acquired
my former employer, <a href="http://www.sibyte.com/">SiByte</a>, in
December, 2000.)


<p>
In the past few years I've done NetBSD-related work at
<a href="http://www.digital.com/">Digital Equipment Corporation's</a>
<a href="http://www.research.compaq.com/SRC/iag/">Internet Appliance
    Group</a> in Palo Alto, California, and
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science's</a>
<a href="http://www.pdl.cs.cmu.edu/">Parallel Data Lab</a>
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Those jobs had me spending
a significant amount of time hacking NetBSD, in addition to performing
other duties.  I've also worked at AT&amp;T Labs in Menlo Park, California,
and a startup called Vayu Communications (now defunct) also in the San
Francisco bay area.  Those jobs didn't have me spending much of my time
on NetBSD-related work.
