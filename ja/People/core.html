<h1>The NetBSD Core Group</h1>

<p>
If the NetBSD Project were a large company, the NetBSD core group would
be the technical management.

<p>
No, it's not just dead weight.  Rather, members of the core group
set the direction and goals of the NetBSD Project as a whole,
promote people's interest in the NetBSD Project and the system it
produces, and consider the serious architectural questions that need to
be addressed if the NetBSD Project is going to keep producing a viable
system.

<p>
The NetBSD Core Group is (in alphabetical order):
