<h1>NetBSD/i386 1.0</h1>

NetBSD/i386 1.0 was the third formal release of
<a href="../../Ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a>.
It included support for many more devices and
for better device autoconfiguration than did NetBSD 0.9, and the i386
was one of the ports for which shared libraries were supported.
Also, the i386-specific portions of the kernel were made
significantly more robust than they had been in NetBSD 0.9, and some
of them were made quite a bit faster in the process.

<p>
Charles Hannum was the maintainer of NetBSD/i386 at the time of
release 1.0, but Chris Demetriou built the release.

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p>
The minimal configuration for a NetBSD/i386 1.0 system
requires 4M of RAM and about 40M of disk space.  For a full
installation (including source and X11), at least 8M of RAM and
200M of disk space are recommended.
