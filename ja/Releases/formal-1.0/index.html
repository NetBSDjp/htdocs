<h1>Information about NetBSD 1.0</h1>

NetBSD 1.0 was the third release of the NetBSD operating system.

<p>
NetBSD 1.0 was released on October 26, 1994, and was the result
of over a year of hard work on the system.  The NetBSD 1.0 kernel
was derived from 4.4BSD-Lite sources, but the user-land utilities
were not yet completely merged with those from Lite.  Because all of
the legally encumbered files in the Berkeley Net/2 distribution had
been replaced with free versions from Lite or had been rewritten,
NetBSD 1.0 was and is completely free of legal entanglements.

<p>
In addition to support for multiple architectures, the NetBSD 1.0
release had many significant improvements.
Some of these improvements, like the faster Fast File System and
support for 64-bit file sizes, came from 4.4BSD-Lite.
Support for dynamically linked
shared libraries was added for most architectures, resulting in a
large disk space savings.  Many bugs were fixed and many other new
features (too many to even consider listing here) were added,
resulting in a system that was more stable, more featureful, and
faster than ever before.
