<h1>NetBSD/amiga 1.0</h1>

NetBSD/amiga 1.0 was the first formal release of
<a href="../../Ports/amiga/">NetBSD/amiga.</a>

<p>
Christian E. Hopps was the maintainer of NetBSD/amiga at the time of the 1.0
release.

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p> NetBSD/amiga 1.0 runs on any amiga that has a 68020 or better CPU
with some form of FPU and MMU.  The minimal configuration requires
4M of RAM and about 65M of disk space.  To install the entire system
requires much more disk space, and to run X or compile the system,
more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will actually allow you to
compile, however it won't be speedy.  X really isn't usable on a
4M system)

<p> Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
<pre>
	partition:      advise, with X, needed, with X
	root (/)        15M     15M     10M     10M
	user (/usr)     65M     100M    45M     80M
	swap            ----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/local)  up to you
</pre>

<p> As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is
large and bulky to accommodate all people).

<p> People with 4M systems should count on allocating a larger
swap partition.

<ul>
