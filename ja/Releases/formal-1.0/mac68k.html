<h1>NetBSD/mac68k 1.0</h1>

NetBSD/mac68k 1.0 was the first formal release of
<a href="../../Ports/mac68k/">NetBSD/mac68k</a>.

<p>
Allen Briggs was the maintainer of NetBSD/mac68k at the time of the 1.0 release.

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p>
NetBSD/mac68k 1.0 runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
A minimal system requires 4M of RAM and about 65M of disk space.
By leaving out a package or two, the system can be squeezed onto
a 40M disk.  At least 8MB of RAM and 200MB of disk space are
recommended for more serious use.  The following Macintosh
hardware is supported:
<ul>
<li> CPUs:
 <ul>
 <li> Mac II
 <li> Mac IIx
 <li> Mac IIcx
 <li> Mac IIci
 <li> Mac SE/30
 </ul>
<li> Internal SCSI bus and most SCSI disks, and CD-ROMs
<li> Internal sound (enough to beep, anyway)
<li> Most basic NuBUS video cards (there have been some problems with
some 24-bit color cards)
<li> Both internal serial ports
<li> ADB keyboards and mice
</ul>

If you have a device that's not listed, it might be compatible with something
else, or we might have simply forgotten it.  If all else fails, maybe you could
write a driver!

<p>
Some systems will boot and are usable from an external terminal (serial tty or
SLIP):
<ul>
<li> Mac IIsi
<li> Mac IIvx
<li> Others?
</ul>

Major items often asked about, but not supported in 1.0 include:
<ul>
<li> Ethernet interfaces.  1.0 does not have a working ethernet
driver, but several cards work with a more
<a href="../../Ports/mac68k/curr_info.html">current</a>
system.
<li> 68040-based Macs.  Work is in progress on getting a Quadra 700
running.  This requires (at least) a new SCSI driver and a new ethernet
driver.
</ul>
Don't see something you're looking for?  Check to see you see if it's in
<a href="../../Ports/mac68k/curr_info.html">the current system</a>
or on the
<a href="../../Ports/mac68k/todo.html">TO-DO list</a>.

<p>
If you're interested in NetBSD/mac68k you should use a
<a href="../../Ports/mac68k/">more recent version</a>.
