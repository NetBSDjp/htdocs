<center><h2>Announcing NetBSD 1.5</h2></center>
<p>

The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that release 1.5 of the
NetBSD operating system is now available.
<p>

NetBSD is widely known as the most portable operating system in the
world.  It currently supports thirty-one different system families and
twelve different CPU families, all from a single source tree, and is
always being ported to more.
<p>

NetBSD 1.5 continues our long tradition with major improvements in
file system and memory management performance, major security
enhancements (including integration of IPsec, SSH and Kerberos 5), and
support for many new platforms and peripherals.
<p>

Complete source and binaries for NetBSD 1.5 are available for download
at <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5/</a> and many of our mirror
sites.  A list of mirror sites is provided at the end of this
announcement.

<h3>About NetBSD</h3>

   The NetBSD operating system is a full-featured, open source,
   Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Networking
   Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2.  NetBSD runs on
   thirty-one different system architectures featuring twelve distinct
   families of CPUs, and is being ported to more.  The NetBSD 1.5
   release contains complete binary releases for twenty different
   machine types.
   <p>

   NetBSD is a highly integrated system.  In addition to its highly
   portable, high performance kernel, NetBSD features a complete set
   of user utilities, compilers for several languages, the X Window
   System, firewall software and numerous other tools, all accompanied
   by full source code.  We also support third party software
   (including the KDE and GNOME desktops) through our package system.
   <p>

   NetBSD is free.  All of the code is under non-restrictive licenses,
   and may be used without paying royalties to anyone.  Free support
   services are available via our mailing lists and web site.
   Commercial support is available from a variety of sources; some are
   listed at:

	</dl>

   NetBSD is the work of a diverse group of people spread around the
   world.  The `Net' in our name is a tribute to the Internet, which
   enables us to communicate and share code, and without which the
   project would not exist.

<h3>Major changes between 1.4 and 1.5</h3>

   It is difficult to completely summarize the extensive development
   between the 1.4 and 1.5 releases.  Some highlights include:
   <p>

   <h4>Kernel</h4>

   <ul>
      <li>Ports to new platforms including: <a href="../../Ports/arc/">arc</a>,
	 <a href="../../Ports/cobalt/">cobalt</a>,
	 <a href="../../Ports/hpcmips/">hpcmips</a>,
	 <a href="../../Ports/news68k/">news68k</a>,
	 <a href="../../Ports/sgimips/">sgimips</a>, and
	 <a href="../../Ports/sparc64/">sparc64</a>.</li>
      <li>Improved performance and stability of the UVM virtual memory
         subsystem.</li>
      <li>Implementation of generic kernel locking code, as well as a
         restructure and re-tuning of the scheduler, to be used by the
         future symmetric multi-processing (SMP) implementation.</li>
      <li>Improved compatibility support for Linux, OSF1, and SVR4
         programs.</li>
      <li>New compatibility support for Win32 programs.</li>
      <li>Support for dynamically loaded ELF kernel modules.</li>
      <li>Kernel process tracing using ktruss(1).</li>
      <li>Deletion of swap devices using swapctl(8).</li>
      <li>Easier hot-swapping of keyboards and mice using a new wscons
         multiplexing device - wsmux.</li>
      <li>Improved PCMCIA and CardBus support, including support for
         detaching of devices and cards, resulting in better support for
         notebooks and PDA devices.</li>
      <li>Numerous hardware improvements, including areas such as: audio,
         UDMA/66 support for ATA drives, USB, and wireless networking.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Networking</h4>

   <ul>
      <li>Addition of IP version 6 (IPv6) and IPsec to the networking
         stack, from the KAME project.  This includes addition of kernel
         code for IPv6/IPsec and conversion of most clients and daemons
         to support both IPv4 and IPv6 (including RPC and NFS over
         IPv6).</li>
      <li>Integration of TI-RPC, and a more `secure' rpcbind(8)
         (supporting communication over an authenticated Unix-domain
         socket, and by default only allowing set and unset requests
         over that channel).</li>
      <li>Integration of OpenSSL, SSH and Heimdal.  (More on this under
         `Security'.)</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>File Systems</h4>

   <ul>
      <li>Significant performance enhancements to the Berkeley Fast File
         System, primarily due to integration of Kirk McKusick's soft
         updates and `trickle sync' code.  Several reliability issues
         were also fixed separately.</li>
      <li>Support for the Windows NT `NTFS' file system (read-only at
         this stage).</li>
      <li>Support for revision 1 of the Linux `ext2fs' file system.</li>
      <li>Enhanced stability and usability of LFS (the BSD log-structured
         file system).</li>
      <li>Various RAIDframe enhancements including: auto-detection of
         RAID components and auto-configuration of RAID sets, and the
         ability to configure the root file system (/) on a RAID set.</li>
      <li>Support for Microsoft Joliet extensions to the ISO 9660 CD file
         system.</li>
      <li>Improved file system vnode locking mechanisms, thus resolving a
         source of several panics in the past.</li>
      <li>Support for RPC and NFS over IPv6.</li>
      <li>Server part of NFS locking (implemented by rpc.lockd(8)) now
         works.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Security</h4>

   <ul>
      <li>Strong cryptographic libraries and applications integrated,
         including the AES cipher Rijndael, the OpenSSL library, more
         complete Kerberos IV and Kerberos V support (from the Heimdal
         project), and an SSH server and client (based on OpenSSH).</li>
      <li>sysctl(3) interfaces to various elements of process and system
         information, allowing programs such as ps(1), dmesg(1) and the
         like to operate without recompilation after kernel upgrades,
         and removing the necessity to run setgid kmem (thus improving
         system security).</li>
      <li>Disable various services by default, and set the default
         options for disabled daemons to a higher level of logging.</li>
      <li>Several code audits were performed.  One audit replaced string
         routines that were used without bound checking, and another one
         to identify and disable places where format strings were used
         in an unsafe way, allowing arbitrary data entered by (possibly)
         malicious users to overwrite application code, and leading from
         Denial of Service attacks to compromised system.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>System administration and user tools</h4>

   <ul>
      <li>Conversion of the rc(8) system startup and shutdown scripts to
         an `rc.d' mechanism, with separate control scripts for each
         service, and appropriate dependency ordering provided by
         rcorder(8).</li>
      <li>postfix(1) provided as alternative mail transport agent to
         sendmail(8).</li>
      <li>User management tools useradd(8), usermod(8), userdel(8),
         groupadd(8), groupmod(8), and groupdel(8) added to the system.</li>
      <li>Incorporation of a login class capability database
         (/etc/login.conf) from BSD/OS.</li>
      <li>Improved support for usernames longer than eight characters in
         programs such as at(1) and w(1).</li>
      <li>Many enhancements to ftpd(8) providing features found in larger
         and less secure FTP daemons, such as user classes, connection
         limits, improved support for virtual hosting, transfer
         statistics, transfer rate throttling, and support for various
         IETF ftpext working group extensions.</li>
      <li>The ftp(1) client has been improved even further, including
         transfer rate throttling, improved URL support, command line
         uploads.  See the man page for details.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

   <ul>
      <li>Transition of i386 and sparc platforms from a.out to the SVR4
         ELF executable format.  (Other platforms using a.out will be
         converted in future releases.)</li>
      <li>Addition of many SUSv2 features to the curses(3) library,
         including support for color.</li>
      <li>Updates of most third party packages that are shipped in the
         base system, including file(1), ipfilter(4), ppp(4),
         sendmail(8), named(8) and dhcpd(8) to the latest stable
         releases.</li>
      <li>Many new packages in the pkgsrc system, including the open
         source desktops KDE and GNOME, as well as the latest Tcl/Tk,
         perl and many of the components of the Java Enterprise
         platform.  The package framework itself now has full wildcard
         dependency support.</li>
      <li>Updates to the NetBSD source code style guide (located in
         /usr/share/misc/style) to use ANSI C only (instead of K&amp;R) and
         reflect current best practice, and begin migrating the NetBSD
         source code to follow it.</li>
   </ul>

   And of course there have also been innumerable bug fixes and other
   miscellaneous enhancements.  Kernel interfaces have continued to be
   refined, and more subsystems and device drivers are shared among
   the different ports.  You can look for this trend to continue.
