<center><h1>Announcing NetBSD 1.5.1</h1></center>

The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that release 1.5.1 of the
NetBSD operating system is now available.  NetBSD 1.5.1 is a patch
release improving stability, fixing bugs in, and adding new features
to NetBSD 1.5.
<p>

Since the release of NetBSD 1.5, nine security related problems were
discovered and fixed.  In addition to fixes for some problems not
formally reported, more than 110 problems reported through our
problem tracking system have been resolved for NetBSD 1.5.1.
<p>

In addition to bug fixes, a number of feature enhancements are
available in NetBSD 1.5.1.  These include support for new hardware,
and updates of e.g. software packages shipped with the NetBSD base
operating system.
<p>

A complete list of changes are available in the CHANGES-1.5.1 file
in top directory of the NetBSD 1.5.1 release tree.  Also, included
later in this announcement, is a list of the major changes between
NetBSD 1.5 and 1.5.1.
<p>

Complete source and binaries for NetBSD 1.5.1 are available for
download at <URL>ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.1/ and many of
our mirror sites.  A list of mirror sites is provided at the end of
this announcement. NetBSD/pc532 and NetBSD/mac68k binaries are still
in the process being built and will be available shortly.
<p>

ISO images will be available shortly.  These will be located
under <URL>ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/ and will include one
image per architecture supported under NetBSD 1.5.1.  Additionally,
there will be images for a 3-CD set of pre-built binary packages
for use with NetBSD/i386.  For these files, you'll want to use
the NetBSD mirror closest to you.

<h2>About NetBSD</h2>
 
    The NetBSD operating system is a full-featured, open source,
    UNIX-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Networking
    Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2.  NetBSD runs on
    forty-four different system architectures featuring sixteen distinct
    families of CPUs, and is being ported to more.  The NetBSD 1.5.1 release
    contains complete binary releases for twenty-one different machine
    types.
    <p>

    NetBSD is a highly integrated system.  In addition to its highly
    portable, high performance kernel, NetBSD features a complete set of
    user utilities, compilers for several languages, the X Window System,
    firewall software and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full
    source code.  We also support third party software (including the KDE
    and GNOME desktops) through our package system.
    <p>

    NetBSD is free.  All of the code is under non-restrictive licenses,
    and may be used without paying royalties to anyone.  Free support
    services are available via our mailing lists and web site.  Commercial
    support is available from a variety of sources; some are listed at:

    NetBSD is the work of a diverse group of people spread around the
    world.  The `Net' in our name is a tribute to the Internet, which
    enables us to communicate and share code, and without which the
    project would not exist.

</ul>
<p>

In addition, many bugs have been fixed -- more than 110 problems
reported through our problem tracking system have been resolved, and
some other non-reported problems have also been found and fixed.  See the <a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.1/CHANGES-1.5.1">CHANGES-1.5.1</a>
file for the complete list.
<p>

The <a href="../../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
Collection (pkgsrc)</a>, which is used to maintain, build,
track dependencies, and maintain NetBSD-specific fixes to third-party
programs, has received a major overhaul for NetBSD 1.5.1.  Some high-
lights are:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>Many new packages were added to the collection, which now includes
    about 2100 packages.  Many of them are also available as pre-compiled
    binaries on ftp.NetBSD.org and its mirrors.  All packages have been
    verified on a release candidate of 1.5.1/i386, and have been found to
    compile, install and de-install cleanly.  Many packages have been
    modified and enhanced to compile and function properly on big-endian
    (m68k, sparc), and LP64 architectures (alpha, sparc64).
    <p>
  <li>KDE2 and KOffice together consitutes a fully integrated office
    environment with no license problems, available for i386, alpha and many
    other architectures.
    <p>
  <li>Mozilla 0.9, KDE2's Konqueror, and Links 0.95 are just a few examples
    of the web browsers available.
    <p>
  <li>A support package for running VMware on NetBSD/i386 was added, it's
    called <PKGSRC>emulators/suse_vmware.  The official VMware code, a valid
    license, and Wasabi Systems' compatibility package are all needed to run
    VMware.
    <p>
  <li>Internal changes of the pkgsrc system include strong checksums to
    prevent malicious distribution files, as well as restructuring of the
    package structure in pkgsrc for faster extraction of pkgsrc tar files
    and upgrades via SUP and CVS.
</ul>
<p>

Please note that at the moment, sysinst will not assist you in installing
pre-built third-party binary packages or the pkgsrc system itself, so you
will have to manually install packages using pkg_install or fetch and
extract the pkgsrc.tgz tar file to get started.
<p>

Lastly, it should be noted that the X11 binaries shipped in NetBSD 1.5.1
is still based on XFree86 version 3.3.6.  Several newer graphics cards
are inadequately supported by that code base, but on the other hand sup
port for several older graphics cards is not available in newer XFree86
code.  NetBSD is in the process of moving to XFree86 version 4, and is
currently maintaining both the XFree86 3.3.6 and the XFree86 version 4
code in the xsrc source set, and you may at compile time pick which
sources to build and install.  To ease installation, testing and use
of the XFree86 version 4 code, a binary snapshot based on XFree86
version 4.0.3 has been made available for <a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a> 1.5.1.
(<b>Update:</b> A binary snapshot based on XFree86 version 4.1.0 is
available for <a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a> 1.5.1)
