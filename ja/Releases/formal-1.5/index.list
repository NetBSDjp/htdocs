</ul>
<p>

In addition, many bugs have been fixed -- more than 110 problems
reported through our problem tracking system have been resolved, and
some other non-reported problems have also been found and fixed.  See the <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.1/CHANGES-1.5.1">CHANGES-1.5.1</a>
file for the complete list.
<p>

The <a href="../../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
Collection (pkgsrc)</a>, which is used to maintain, build,
track dependencies, and maintain NetBSD-specific fixes to third-party
programs, has received a major overhaul for NetBSD 1.5.1.  Some high-
lights are:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>Many new packages were added to the collection, which now includes
    about 2100 packages.  Many of them are also available as pre-compiled
    binaries on ftp.netbsd.org and its mirrors.  All packages have been
    verified on a release candidate of 1.5.1/i386, and have been found to
    compile, install and de-install cleanly.  Many packages have been
    modified and enhanced to compile and function properly on big-endian
    (m68k, sparc), and LP64 architectures (alpha, sparc64).
    <p>
  <li>KDE2 and KOffice together consitutes a fully integrated office
    environment with no license problems, available for i386, alpha and many
    other architectures.
    <p>
  <li>Mozilla 0.9, KDE2's Konqueror, and Links 0.95 are just a few examples
    of the web browsers available.
    <p>
  <li>A support package for running VMware on NetBSD/i386 was added, it's
    called <PKGSRC>emulators/suse_vmware.  The official VMware code, a valid
    license, and Wasabi Systems' compatibility package are all needed to run
    VMware.
    <p>
  <li>Internal changes of the pkgsrc system include strong checksums to
    prevent malicious distribution files, as well as restructuring of the
    package structure in pkgsrc for faster extraction of pkgsrc tar files
    and upgrades via SUP and CVS.
</ul>
<p>

Please note that at the moment, sysinst will not assist you in installing
pre-built third-party binary packages or the pkgsrc system itself, so you
will have to manually install packages using pkg_install or fetch and
extract the pkgsrc.tgz tar file to get started.
<p>

Lastly, it should be noted that the X11 binaries shipped in NetBSD 1.5.1
is still based on XFree86 version 3.3.6.  Several newer graphics cards
are inadequately supported by that code base, but on the other hand sup-
port for several older graphics cards is not available in newer XFree86
code.  NetBSD is in the process of moving to XFree86 version 4, and is
currently maintaining both the XFree86 3.3.6 and the XFree86 version 4
code in the xsrc source set, and you may at compile time pick which
sources to build and install.  To ease installation, testing and use
of the XFree86 version 4 code, a binary snapshot based on XFree86
version 4.0.3 has been made available for <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a> 1.5.1.
(<b>Update:</b> A binary snapshot based on XFree86 version 4.1.0 is
available for <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a> 1.5.1)

<h2><a name="major-changes-1.5">Major changes between 1.4 and 1.5</a></h2>

      It is difficult to completely summarize the extensive
      development between the 1.4 and 1.5 releases.  Some
      highlights include: 
<p>

<!--

  The following is taken from src/distrib/notes/i386/INSTALL.html.
  Please update if needed!

-->

<h4><a name="Kernel">Kernel</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
Ports to new platforms including:
arc,
cobalt,
hpcmips,
news68k,
sgimips,
and
sparc64.
<p><li>
Improved performance and stability of the UVM virtual memory subsystem.
<p><li>
Implementation of generic kernel locking code, as well as a
restructure and re-tuning of the scheduler, to be used by the
future symmetric multi-processing (SMP) implementation.
<p><li>
Improved compatibility support for Linux, OSF1, and SVR4 programs.
<p><li>
New compatibility support for Win32 programs.
<p><li>
Support for dynamically loaded ELF kernel modules.
<p><li>
Kernel process tracing using
<code>ktruss(1)</code>.
<p><li>
Deletion of swap devices using
<code>swapctl(8)</code>.
<p><li>
Easier hot-swapping of keyboards and mice using a new wscons
multiplexing device - wsmux.
<p><li>
Improved PCMCIA and CardBus support, including support for detaching
of devices and cards, resulting in better support for notebooks and
PDA devices.
<p><li>
Numerous hardware improvements, including areas such as:
audio, UDMA/66 support for ATA drives, USB, and wireless networking.
</ul>
<h4><a name="Networking">Networking</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
Addition of IP version 6 (IPv6) and IPsec to the networking stack,
from the KAME project.
This includes addition of kernel code for IPv6/IPsec and conversion of
most clients and daemons to support both IPv4 and IPv6 (including RPC
and NFS over IPv6).
<p><li>
Integration of TI-RPC, and more `secure' rpcbind(8) (supporting communication
over an authenticated Unix-domain socket, and by default only allowing set
and unset requests over that channel).
<p><li>
Integration of OpenSSL, SSH and Heimdal.  (More on this under `Security'.)
</ul>
<h4><a name="File Systems">File Systems</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
Significant performance enhancements to the Berkeley Fast File System,
primarily due to
integration of Kirk McKusick's soft updates and `trickle sync' code.
Several reliability issues were also fixed separately.
<p><li>
Support for the Windows NT `NTFS' file system (read-only at this stage).
<p><li>
Support for revision 1 of the Linux `ext2fs' file system.
<p><li>
Enhanced stability and usability of LFS (the
BSD
log-structured file system).
<p><li>
Various RAIDframe enhancements including: auto-detection of RAID components
and auto-configuration of RAID sets, and the ability to configure the root
file system
(<code>/</code>)
on a RAID set.
<p><li>
Support for Microsoft Joliet extensions to the ISO 9660 CD file system.
<p><li>
Improved file system vnode locking mechanisms,
thus resolving a source of several panics in the past.
<p><li>
Support for RPC and NFS over IPv6.
<p><li>
Server part of NFS locking (implemented by
<code>rpc.lockd(8)</code>)
now works.
</ul>
<h4><a name="Security">Security</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
Strong cryptographic libraries and applications integrated,
including the AES cipher Rijndael, the OpenSSL library, more
complete Kerberos IV and Kerberos V support (from the Heimdal project),
and an SSH server and client (based on OpenSSH).
<p><li>
<code>sysctl(3)</code>
interfaces to various elements of process and system information,
allowing programs such as
<code>ps(1)</code>,
<code>dmesg(1)</code>
and the like to operate without recompilation after kernel upgrades,
and remove the necessity to run setgid kmem (thus improving system
security).
<p><li>
Disable various services by default, and set the default options for
disabled daemons to a higher level of logging.
<p><li>
Several code audits were performed. One audit replaced
string routines that were used without bound checking, and another
one to identify and disable
places where format strings were used in an
unsafe way, allowing arbitrary data entered by (possibly) malicious
users to overwrite application code, and leading from Denial of
Service attacks to compromised system.
</ul>
<h4><a name="System administration and user tools">System administration and user tools</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
Conversion of the
<code>rc(8)</code>
system startup and shutdown scripts to an
`rc.d'
mechanism, with separate control scripts for each service, and
appropriate dependency ordering provided by
<code>rcorder(8)</code>.
<p><li>
<code>postfix(1)</code>
provided as alternative mail transport agent to
<code>sendmail(8)</code>.
<p><li>
User management tools
<code>useradd(8)</code>,
<code>usermod(8)</code>,
<code>userdel(8)</code>,
<code>groupadd(8)</code>,
<code>groupmod(8)</code>,
and
<code>groupdel(8)</code>
added to the system.
<p><li>
Incorporation of a login class capability database
(<code>/etc/login.conf</code>)
from BSD/OS.
<p><li>
Improved support for usernames longer than eight characters in programs
such as
<code>at(1)</code>
and
<code>w(1)</code>.
<p><li>
Many enhancements to
<code>ftpd(8)</code>
providing features found in larger and less secure FTP daemons,
such as user classes, connection limits, improved support for
virtual hosting, transfer statistics, transfer rate throttling,
and support for various IETF ftpext working group extensions.
<p><li>
The
<code>ftp(1)</code>
client has been improved even further, including
transfer rate throttling, improved URL support, command line uploads.
See the man page for details.
</ul>
<h4><a name="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
Transition of i386 and sparc platforms from a.out to the SVR4 ELF
executable format.  (Other platforms using a.out will be converted in
future releases.)
<p><li>
Addition of many SUSv2 features to the
<code>curses(3)</code>
library, including support for color.
<p><li>
Updates of most third party packages that are shipped in the base
system, including
<code>file(1)</code>,
<code>ipfilter(4)</code>,
<code>ppp(4)</code>,
<code>sendmail(8)</code>,
<code>named(8)</code>
and
<code>dhcpd(8)</code>,
to the latest stable releases.
<p><li>
Many new packages in the
<em>pkgsrc</em>
system, including the open source desktops KDE and GNOME, as well as the
latest Tcl/Tk, perl and many of the components of the Java Enterprise platform.
The package framework itself now has full wildcard dependency support.
<p><li>
Updates to the
NetBSD
source code style guide (located in
<code>/usr/share/misc/style</code>)
to use ANSI C only (instead of K&amp;R) and reflect current best practice,
and begin migrating the
NetBSD source code to follow it.
</ul>
  
  
And of course there have also been innumerable bug fixes and other
miscellaneous enhancements.
Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems and
device drivers are shared among the different ports.  You can look for
this trend to continue.
