<center><h1>Announcing NetBSD 1.5.2</h1></center>

The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that release 1.5.2 of the
NetBSD operating system is now available.
<p>

NetBSD 1.5.2 is a patch release mostly intended to address recently
discovered security vulnerabilities as well as platform-specific
problems.  The NetBSD Project recommends that you upgrade NetBSD 1.5 or
1.5.1 systems to 1.5.2 at your earliest convenience.
<p>

A complete list of changes are available in the CHANGES-1.5.2 file
in top directory of the NetBSD 1.5.2 release tree.  Also, included
later in this announcement, is a list of the major changes added
between NetBSD 1.5.1 and 1.5.2.
<p>

Complete source and binaries for NetBSD 1.5.2 are available for download
at many sites around the world.  A list of download sites via FTP,
AnonCVS, SUP, and other methods is provided at the end of this
announcement; the latest list of available download sites may also be
found at:  <a href="../../mirrors/">http://www.netbsd.org/mirrors/</a>
<p>

CD images (ISOs), bootable on some platforms, will be available as of
Sunday, 16 September 2001.  Also included are three binary package CD
images identical to those distributed for NetBSD 1.5.1.  These will be
available at the <a href="../../mirrors/#iso">download sites listed
under the "ISO image mirrors" section</a>.

<h2>About NetBSD</h2>
 
    The NetBSD operating system is a full-featured, open source,
    UNIX-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Networking
    Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2.  NetBSD runs on
    44 different system architectures featuring 16 distinct families
    of CPUs, and is being ported to more.  The NetBSD 1.5.2 release
    contains complete binary releases for 21 different machine
    types.
    <p>

    NetBSD is a highly integrated system.  In addition to its highly
    portable, high performance kernel, NetBSD features a complete set of
    user utilities, compilers for several languages, the X Window System,
    firewall software and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full
    source code.  We also support third party software (including the KDE
    and GNOME desktops) through our package system.
    <p>

    <p>

    NetBSD is free.  All of the code is under non-restrictive licenses,
    and may be used without paying royalties to anyone.  Free support
    services are available via our mailing lists and web site.  Commercial
    support is available from a variety of sources; some are listed at:

    NetBSD is the work of a diverse group of people spread around the
    world.  The `Net' in our name is a tribute to the Internet, which
    enables us to communicate and share code, and without which the
    project would not exist.

<h2>Major Changes Between 1.5.1 and 1.5.2</h2>

The complete list of changes between NetBSD 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 can be found
in the file <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.2/CHANGES-1.5.2">CHANGES-1.5.2</a>
in the top directory of the source tree.  The following are highlights
only:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed buffer overflow bug in telnetd; see Security Advisory
    <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2001-012.txt.asc">SA#2001-012</a>.
    <p>
  <li>Fixed weakness in OpenSSL random number generator; see Security
    Advisory <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2001-013.txt.asc">SA#2001-013</a>.
    <p>
  <li>Fixed dump and dump_lfs to drop setgid-tty privileges; see 
    Security Advisory <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2001-014.txt.asc">SA#2001-014</a>.
    <p>
  <li>Added bounds checks to values passed from userland to kernel; see
    Security Advisory <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2001-015.txt.asc">SA#2001-015</a>.
    <p>
  <li>Fixed unsafe use of chdir(2) in fts(3); see Security Advisory
    <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2001-016.txt.asc">SA#2001-016</a>.
    <p>
  <li>Fixed root compromise bug in Sendmail 8.11.3; see Security 
    Advisory <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2001-017.txt.asc">SA#2001-017</a>.
    <p>
  <li>Several bugs in the installation system on some platforms (causing
    NetBSD 1.5.1 not to install properly) have been fixed.
    <p>
  <li>The DHCP software has been upgraded to ISC version 3, Release 
    Candidate 10, fixing additional bugs.
</ul>
<p>

The <a href="../../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
Collection (pkgsrc)</a>, which is used to maintain, build,
track dependencies, and maintain NetBSD-specific fixes to third-party
programs, has been shipped with NetBSD 1.5.2 using the same source file
(pkgsrc.tgz) as was shipped in NetBSD 1.5.1.
<p>

Please note that at the moment, sysinst will not assist you in installing
pre-built third-party binary packages or the pkgsrc system itself, so you
will have to manually install packages using pkg_install or fetch and
extract the pkgsrc.tgz tar file to get started.
<p>

Lastly, it should be noted that the X11 binaries shipped in NetBSD 1.5.2
are still based on XFree86 version 3.3.6.  Several newer graphics cards
are inadequately supported by that code base, but on the other hand sup
port for several older graphics cards is not available in newer XFree86
code.  NetBSD is in the process of moving to XFree86 version 4, and is
currently maintaining both the XFree86 3.3.6 and the XFree86 version 4
code in the xsrc source set, and you may at compile time pick which
sources to build and install.  To ease installation, testing and use of
the XFree86 version 4 code, a binary snapshot based on XFree86 version
4.1.0 has been made available for NetBSD/i386 1.5.x at:
<URL>ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

    The NetBSD Foundation would like to thank all those who have
    contributed code, hardware, documentation, funds, colocation for
    our servers, web pages and other documentation, release engineering,
    and other resources over the years.  More information on contributors
    is available at:

    We would like to especially thank the University of California at
    Berkeley and the GNU Project for particularly large subsets of code
    that we use, and the Internet Software Consortium, Redback Networks
    and the Helsinki University of Technology for current colocation
    services.
    <p>

    Last but not least, we would like to mention the fact that NetBSD's
    and every other Unix systems' internal clock just counted 10^9 since
    the epoch (Jan 1, 1970).  We look forward to provide a stable, fast
    and secure operating system for the next billion of seconds!

<h2>About the NetBSD Foundation</h2>

    The NetBSD Foundation was chartered in 1995, with the task of
    overseeing core NetBSD project services, promoting the project
    within industry and the open source community, and holding
    intellectual property rights on much of the NetBSD code base.
    Day-to-day operations of the project are handled by volunteers.
