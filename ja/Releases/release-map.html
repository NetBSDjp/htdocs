<h1>NetBSD release glossary and graphs</h1>

NetBSD is available in three forms:
<p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#release">Formal release</a>
      - tested, production version.
  <li><a href="#NetBSD-release">NetBSD-release</a>
      - maintenance (patch) tree.
  <li><a href="#current">NetBSD-current</a>
      - feature (development) tree.
</ul>
<p>

Additionally, there are graphs showing 
the <a href="#graph1">history of NetBSD-1.3</a> and
<a href="#graph2">an overview of release branches</a>
as an example.

    <strong>NetBSD-current</strong></a>

<dd>
NetBSD-current is the main development branch of NetBSD, it's
the "bleeding edge" of NetBSD development. The version
is always in the form of a number followed by a letter, and
will develop into the next formal <em>major</em> release. Eg:
<strong>1.5F</strong> eventually became <strong>1.6</strong>.
The kernel's version letter is incremented when the interface
between kernel and userland is changed.
<p>

NetBSD-current is available via SUP, CVS, <a
href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/">cvsweb</a>,
and FTP in <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/">
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current</a>.
<p>

You should be aware that in BSD CSRG terms, -current is normally
an alpha quality distribution. It isn't even guaranteed to
compile.
<p>

<dt><a name="release" href="../Releases/formal.html">
    <strong>Formal release</strong></a>

<dd>
An official, believed to be reliable source and binary distribution
of NetBSD. Consists either of a major release like 1.5, or of a
patch release like 1.5.1.
<p>

After a release is done, urgent bug fixes are ported back to
the <a href="#NetBSD-release">release branch</a>, and patch releases
(e.g. NetBSD-1.4.1) are done. You should be aware that a patch
release is more reliable than -current of the same date, but
is missing features.  Most particularly, it usually doesn't
work to mix a patch release with -current for both userland
and kernel.
<p>

<dt><a name="NetBSD-release"><strong>NetBSD-release</strong></a>

<dd>
A release branch is the last release, plus whatever
bug fixes will be going into the next patch release, pulled
up from the NetBSD-current development branch. E.g. if the
latest release is <strong>1.5</strong>, the release branch for
it is "netbsd-1-5" which can be thought of containing an alpha-version
of <strong>1.5.1</strong>.
<p>

The NetBSD-release branch(es) can be considered an easy way to get the most
up to date fixes for the most recent release.
<p>

There are daily updated snapshots of the release branches,
available via both CVS, FTP and SUP.
The directories <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-4/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-4</a>
and <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-5/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-5</a>
contain the extracted sources plus weekly updated tar files of both the 1.4
and 1.5 release branches respectively.
These files are created in a similar manner to those in the <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current</a>
directory.
<p>

<dt><a name="snapshot"><strong>Snapshots</strong></a>

<dd>
Snapshots are usually done by a port maintainer, and can be
of NetBSD-current or NetBSD-release branches. Usually the easiest way
to start tracking -current is by installing a recent snapshot.
