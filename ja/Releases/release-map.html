<h1>NetBSD release glossary and graph</h1>

Many people seem to be confused by the naming of formal NetBSD
releases, snapshots, the source tree, etc. Here are some definitions
to help you. Additionally, there is a <a href="#graph">graph</a>
showing the history of NetBSD-1.3 as an example.
<hr>

<DL>

<DT><a name="current" href="../Releases/current.html">current</a>

<DD>This view of the source tree is available to external developers
and other people wanting to use (or, kindly volunteering to test)
the latest developed features, at the cost of reliability. It is
available through SUP and through FTP of <tt>tar</tt> archives; mirror
sites might offer additional methods.

<p>
Normally, this is the main branch of the archive. During <a
href="#release">release cycles</a>, this is switched to the release
branch; after the release is done, the changes in the release are
merged back into the main branch, if appropriate.  After that
-current is switched back to the main branch. You should be aware that
in BSD CSRG terms, -current is normally an alpha quality
distribution. It isn't even guaranteed to compile.

<p>
Especially when incompatible changes to the kernel/userland-interface
are made, the centiversion is incremented (1.2A, 1.2B, etc.).
Hopefully, a carefully worked out upgrade path is published on the
current-users mailing list. (This is why you <em>must</em> read this
mailing list, if you are running NetBSD-current).

<dt><a name="release" href="../Releases/formal.html">formal release</a>

<dd>An official, believed to be reliable source and binary distribution
of NetBSD. A release is done by creating a branch of the source tree.
After a first test of the release building tools has been done
(e.g. NetBSD-1.2_ALPHA) it is frozen; that is, no more features may be
added, and bug fixes may only be added by -- or on consent of -- the
release engineer. Usually one or more beta release binaries
(NetBSD-1.2_BETA) are built per architecture for testing purposes.

<p> During this time, many developers concentrate on the release
branch. This is why after a release, the changes on the release branch
are merged back into the main branch.

<p> After a release is done, urgent bug fixes are ported back to the
release branch, and patch releases (e.g. NetBSD-1.2.1) are done. You
should be aware that a patch release is more reliable than -current of
the same date, but is missing features.  Most particularly, it usually
doesn't work to mix a patch release with -current.

<dt><a name="snapshot">snapshot release</a>

<dd>Snapshot releases are usually done by a port maintainer, when
he/she feels that enough things have changed to make it impractical to
update the latest formal release through simple recompilation. Simple
snapshots just consist of tar archives of the /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin
etc. directory trees. They can only be used if you already have an
installed system. Sometimes (especially during release cycles) there
are also release style snapshots, which can be used to install a new
machine (although they are intended to test the installation tools).
