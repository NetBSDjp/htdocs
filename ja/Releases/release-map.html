<h1>NetBSD release glossary and graph</h1>

NetBSD is available in three forms:
<ul>
<li><a href="#release">formal release</a>
	- tested, production version.
<li><a href="#NetBSD-release">NetBSD-release</a>
	- maintenance (patch) tree.
<li><a href="#current">NetBSD-current</a>
	- feature (development) tree.
</ul>
Additionally, there is a <a href="#graph">graph</a>
showing the history of NetBSD-1.3 as an example.
<hr>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="current" href="../Releases/current.html">
    <strong>NetBSD-current</strong></a>

<dd>This is the "bleeding edge" of NetBSD development. The version
    is always in the form of a number followed by a letter, and
    will develop into the <em>next</em> formal release. (eg:
    <strong>1.3F</strong> eventually became <strong>1.4</strong>).
    The letter is incremented when the kernel/userland-interface is
    changed.

<p> It is available via SUP, CVS, <a
    href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi">cvsweb</a>,
    and ftp in <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/">
    ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current</a>.

<p> You should be aware that in BSD CSRG terms, -current is normally
    an alpha quality distribution. It isn't even guaranteed to
    compile.

<p>
<dt><a name="release" href="../Releases/formal.html">
    <strong>formal release</strong></a>

<dd>An official, believed to be reliable source and binary distribution
    of NetBSD.

<p> After a release is done, urgent bug fixes are ported back to
    the <a href="#NetBSD-release">release branch</a>, and patch releases
    (e.g. NetBSD-1.2.1) are done. You should be aware that a patch
    release is more reliable than -current of the same date, but
    is missing features.  Most particularly, it usually doesn't
    work to mix a patch release with -current.

<p>
<dt><a name="NetBSD-release"><strong>NetBSD-release</strong></a>

<dd>This is a daily updated snapshot of the release branch,
    available via both FTP and SUP.

<p> The NetBSD-release branch is the last release, plus whatever
    bug fixes will be going into the next patch release. So if the
    latest release is <strong>1.4.1</strong>, NetBSD-release can
    be thought of pre-release <strong>1.4.2</strong>.

<p> It can be considered an easy way to get the most up to date
    fixes for the most recent release.

<p> The directory <a
    href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release/">
    ftp.netbsd.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release</a> contains the
    extracted sources plus weekly updated tar files.  These files
    are created in a similar manner to those in the <a
    href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/">
    /pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current</a> directory.

<p>
<dt><a name="snapshot"><strong>snapshots</strong></a>

<dd>Snapshots are usually done by a port maintainer, and can be
    of NetBSD-current or NetBSD-release. Usually the easiest way
    to start tracking -current is to start by installing a recent snapshot.
