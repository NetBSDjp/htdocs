<h1>NetBSD/mac68k 1.2</h1>

NetBSD/mac68k 1.2 was the third formal release of
<a href="../../Ports/mac68k/">NetBSD/mac68k</a>.

<p>
<a href="mailto:scottr@NetBSD.ORG">Scott Reynolds</a>
was the maintainer of NetBSD/mac68k at the time of the 1.2 release

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p>
NetBSD/mac68k 1.2 runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
A minimal system requires 4M of RAM and about 65M of disk space.
By leaving out a package or two, the system can be squeezed onto
a 40M disk.  At least 8MB of RAM and 200MB of disk space are
recommended for more serious use.  The following Macintosh
hardware is supported:
<ul>
  <li> CPUs:
      <ul>
	<li> Mac II (with PMMU)
	<li> Mac IIx
	<li> Mac IIcx
	<li> Mac IIci
	<li> Mac SE/30
	<li> Mac IIsi
	<li> Mac IIvx
	<li> Mac IIvi
	<li> Performa 600/600CD
	<li> LC 550, Performa 550
	<li> MacTV
      </ul>
  <li> Internal SCSI bus and most SCSI tapes, disks, and CD-ROMs
  <li> Internal sound (enough to beep on some machines, anyway)
  <li> Most basic NuBUS video cards (there have been some problems with
      some 24-bit color cards)
  <li> Both internal serial ports
  <li> ADB keyboards and mice
  <li> NUBUS ethernet cards based on the National Semiconductor 8390
      (Asante, Apple, and a few others; see the
      <a href="http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/macbsd-docs/ethernet.html">ethernet status page</a>)
  <li>Machines with no FPU.  Floating point emulation for '030-based
      machines without a 68882 is now available.
</ul>

If you have a device that's not listed, it might be compatible with something
else, or we might have simply forgotten it.  If all else fails, maybe you could
write a driver!

<p>
Some systems will boot and are usable from an external terminal
(serial tty or SLIP):
<ul>
  <li> LC III, LC II
  <li> Some PowerBooks (PB 145, 160, 165c, 170, 180)
  <li> Possibly others
</ul>
Please note that many of these systems will work with custom kernels.
Check out the
<a href="http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/macbsd-docs/machine-status/">machine
status page</a> for details.


Major items often asked about, but not supported in 1.2 include:
<ul>
  <li> Other ethernet interfaces.  There is no driver written yet for 
      interface cards built on the SONIC (83932) chip.
  <li> 68040-based Macs.  Work is in progress on getting a many of the
      Quadras running.  This requires (at least) a new SCSI driver
      and a new ethernet driver.
  <li>Accelerator cards are not supported with cache enabled. Most 68030
      accelerators run NetBSD/Mac68k with cache disabled.  There may be a 
      version of NetBSD-current that will permit the cache to be enabled soon.
  <li>PowerMac  - That is not the Mac 68k platform.  PowerPC is a 
      completely different architecture.  Work is proceeding on that,
      too, but it is not part of this port.
</ul>
