<h1>NetBSD/amiga 1.2</h1>

<p>
NetBSD/amiga 1.2 was the third <a href="../formal.html">formal release</a> of
<a href="../../Ports/amiga/">NetBSD/amiga.</a>

<p>
Christian E. Hopps was the maintainer of NetBSD/amiga at the time of the 1.2
release.

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p>
NetBSD/amiga 1.2 runs on any Amiga that has a 68020 or better CPU with
some form of FPU and MMU, and on DraCos which still have a CIA.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and about 65M of disk
space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space,
and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of
RAM will actually allow you to compile, however it won't be speedy. X
really isn't usable on a 4M system.)

<p> Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
<pre>
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
	user (/usr)	65M	100M	55M 	90M
	swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/local)	up to you
</pre>

<p> As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is
large and bulky to accommodate all people).

<p> People with 4M systems should count on allocating a larger
swap partition.

<p> Devices supported by NetBSD/amiga 1.2 include:

<ul>
<li> A4000/A1200 IDE controller
<li> SCSI host adapters:
 <ul>
 <li> 33c93 based boards: A2091, A3000 builtin, and GVP Series II

 <li> 53c80 based boards: 12 Gauge, IVS, Wordsync, Bytesync and
<a href="#bugs:emplant">Emplant</a>

 <li> 53c710 based boards: A4091, Magnum, Warp Engine, Zeus and DraCo builtin.

 <li> FAS216 based boards: <a href="#bugs:FAS">FastLane Z3, Blizzard I
and II</a>

 </ul>
<li> Video controllers:
 <ul>
 <li> ECS, AGA and A2024 built-in on various Amigas
 <li> Retina Z2, Retina Z3 and Altais.
 <li> Picasso II.
 <li> GVP Spectrum.
 <li> Piccolo.
 <li> Piccolo SD64
 <li> A2410.
 <li> Cybervision 64.

 <li> A2065 Ethernet
 <li> A4066 Ethernet
 <li> Ariadne Ethernet
 <li> ASDG Ethernet
 <li> Hydra Ethernet
 <li> Quicknet Ethernet
 </ul>
<li> Tape drives:
 <ul>
 <li> Most SCSI tape drives including:
  <ul>
  <li> Archive Viper
  <li> Cipher SCSI-2 ST150
  </ul>
 </ul>
<li> CD-ROM drives:
 <ul>
 <li> Most SCSI CD-ROM drives
 </ul>

<li> Scanners:

 With the machine independent PINT interface integrated, these <a
href="#bugs:scsiscanner">should work</a>:

 <ul>
  <li> SCSI-2 scanners behaving like SCSI-2 scanner devices
  <li> HP Scanjet II
  <li> Mustek SCSI scanners
 </ul>

<li> <a href="#bugs:floppy">Amiga floppy drives</a> with Amiga (880kB
/ 1760kB) and IBM (720kB / 1440 kB) block encoding.
<li> Amiga parallel port
<li> Amiga serial port
<li> Amiga mouse
</ul>

<p>
If it is not on the above lists, there is no support for it in this release.
Especially (but this is an incomplete list), there is no driver for:

Cyberstorm SCSI options, Blizzard III SCSI, Blizzard IV SCSI, Ferret SCSI,
Oktagon SCSI.

If you're interested in installing NetBSD/amiga 1.2, you should look at
the <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-archive/NetBSD-1.2/amiga/INSTALL">installation
notes</a>.

<h2> Known problems with some hardware </h2>

<ul>

 <li><a name="bugs:emplant">the Emplant SCSI adapter</a> has been
 reported by a party to hang after doing part of the installation
 without problems.

 <li><a name="bugs:FAS">Fastlane SCSI</a> is reported to show data
 errors and hangs at least when used with multiple devices on the
 bus. This might be a problem with any FAS board.

 <li> <a name="bugs:scsiscanner">SCSI scanner support</a>is machine
 independent, so it should work, but hasn't been tested yet on most
 Amiga configurations. There are reports that it Mustek and HP Scanjet
 hang if accessed from the A3000. This might apply to other
 33C93-Adapters, too.

 <li> <a name="bugs:floppy">Our floppy driver</a> doesn't notice when
 mounted floppies are write-protected at the moment. Your floppy will
 stay unchanged, but you might not notice that you didn't write
 anything due to the buffer cache.

</ul>

<p>
If you're interested in NetBSD/amiga you should use a
<a href="../../Ports/amiga/">more recent version</a>.
