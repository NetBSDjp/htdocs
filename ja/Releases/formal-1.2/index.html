<h1>Information about NetBSD 1.2</h1>

NetBSD 1.2 was the fifth release of the NetBSD operating system.

<p>
NetBSD 1.2 was released on October 4, 1996.
The current release has built upon the successful NetBSD 1.1 release
by integrating many bug fixes, adding new and updated kernel
subsystems, and adding various userland enhancements.  The results of
these improvements is a stable operating system fit for production use
and ready for the next phase of development.

<p>
NetBSD 1.2.1 was released on May 20, 1997.
This maintenance release has no new functionality, but contains hundreds
of fixes for bugs and security holes.

<p>
Significant changes from NetBSD 1.1 include:

<ul>
<li> Continuing the multi-platform tradition, the integration of
     the DEC Alpha port has been completed, and new ports to ARM
     and x68k have been added.
<li> NetBSD/sparc now supports 4m machines.
<li> NetBSD/amiga now supports the DraCo.
<li> Standard C Prototypes have been added to the Kernel.
<li> Kernel NTP (Network Time Protocol) phased lock loop support
     has been added.  See 
     <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/">
     http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/</a> for more details.
<li> The PINT (PINT is not TWAIN) SCSI scanner driver interface
     has been integrated.
<li> A new SCSI medium changer driver and the `chio' program
     used to operate it has been added.
<li> The NFS subsystem now supports NFSv3.
<li> Several performance enhancements have been made to the
     networking subsystem.
<li> GCC, Libg++, and many other third party programs have been
     upgraded to more recent versions.
</ul>

<p>
Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems
and device drivers are shared among the different ports. You can look
for this trend to continue.

<p>
NetBSD 1.2 also includes some refinement to the NetBSD binary emulation
system (which includes FreeBSD, HP-UX, iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4,
Solaris and Ultrix compatibility), bringing NetBSD closer to the goal of
making the emulation as accurate as possible.
