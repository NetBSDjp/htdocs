<h1>NetBSD/i386 1.2</h1>

<p>
NetBSD/i386 1.2 was the fifth formal release of
<a href="../../Ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a>.

<p>
Charles Hannum and Frank van der Linden were the maintainers of NetBSD/i386
at the time of the 1.2 release.

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p>
NetBSD/i386 1.2 runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The
minimal configuration is said to require 4M of RAM and 50M of disk space,
though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite this minimal today.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will
actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it won't be speedy.
Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.)

Devices supported by NetBSD/i386 1.2 include:
<ul>
<li> Floppy controllers.
 <ul>
 <li> MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
 </ul>
<li> SCSI host adapters:
<ul>
 <li> Adaptec AHA-154xA, -B, -C, and -CF 
 <li> Adaptec AHA-174x
 <li> Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 based boards, including
      the Adaptec AHA-152x and the SoundBlaster SCSI
      host adapter.  (Note that you cannot boot from
      these boards if they do not have a boot ROM;
      only the AHA-152x and motherboards using this chip
      are likely to be bootable, consequently.)
 <li> Adaptec AHA-2x4x[U][W] cards and some onboard PCI designs
      using the AIC78X0 chip.  There is a known problem
      using this driver with AHA-2742 cards or AIC7770 or
      AIC78[56]0 based embedded designs and multiple
      targets, due to resource contention which is not
      handled well by NetBSD's higher-level SCSI subsystem.
 <li> Adaptec AHA-3940[U][W] cards [b]
 <li> Buslogic 54x (Adaptec AHA-154x clones)
 <li> BusLogic 445, 74x, 9xx  (But not the new "FlashPoint" series
      of BusLogic SCSI adapters)
 <li> Seagate/Future Domain ISA SCSI adapter cards, including
  <ul>
  <li> ST01/02
  <li> Future Domain TMC-885
  <li> Future Domain TMC-950
  </ul>
 <li> Symbios Logic (NCR) 53C8xx-based PCI SCSI host adapters:
  <ul>
  <li> Acculogic PCIpport
  <li> ASUS SC-200 (requires NCR BIOS on motherboard)
  <li> ASUS SP3[G] motherboard onboard SCSI
  <li> DEC Celebris XL/590 onboard SCSI
  <li> Lomas Data SCSI adapters
  <li> NCR/SYM 8125 (and its many clones; be careful, some
       of these cards have a jumper to set the PCI interrupt; leave it on
       INT A!)
  <li> Promise DC540 (a particularly common OEM model of the SYM 8125)
  <li> Tyan Yorktown
  </ul>
 <li> Ultrastor 14f, 34f, and (possibly) 24f
 <li> Western Digital WD7000 SCSI host adapters (ISA cards only)
</ul>
<li> MDA, CGA, VGA, SVGA, and HGC Display Adapters.  (Note that not
     all of the display adapters NetBSD/i386 can work with are supported by X.
     See the XFree86 FAQ for more information.)

 </ul>
<li> CD-ROM drives:
 <ul>
 <li> Non-IDE Mitsumi CD-ROM drives. (Note: The Mitsumi driver device probe is
      known to cause some trouble with devices configured at the same address)

<p>

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
<ul>
<li> AMD PCscsi SCSI host adapters (though the PCnet portion of the
     PCnet-SCSI works fine)
<li> APM power management -- if your system supports it, turn it off!
<li> Intel EtherExpress 100 Fast Ethernet adapters.
<li> Multiprocessor Pentium and Pentium Pro systems.  (Though they should
     run fine using one processor only.)
<li> NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
<li> PCI WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.
<li> PCMCIA ("PC Card") devices, including some miniature "IDE" hard disks.
<li> QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.  (Those are the tape drives that connect
     to the floppy disk controller.)
</ul>

We are planning future support for many of these devices.
