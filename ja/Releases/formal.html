<h1>Formal NetBSD Releases</h1>

<a href="../Releases/release-map.html">Formal releases of NetBSD</a>
are intended to provide a stable, supported
platform on which people can base their work.  They provide a balance
between features and stability.  They are also typically easier to
install than <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.

<h2>Why use a formal release?</h2>

<p>
Because they are well-tested and made relatively infrequently, formal
releases are useful for people who don't want to be on the "bleeding
edge" of development, or who just want to run applications.
Since formal releases are effectively unchanging (there are typically
very few official patches made to them), they are
relatively easy to support, both by NetBSD's developers and the
developers of applications.  The biggest problem with running the
latest formal release of NetBSD is that you don't have access
to the latest features and bug fixes in the development tree.
</p>

<p>
Formal releases are relatively easy to install.  All of the platforms
supported by a formal release come with a detailed set of installation
instructions, and most also include some sort of bootstrapping media.
(For example, the i386 port typically uses floppy disk images to
bootstrap, while the amiga and hp300 ports use a miniroot filesystem
image.)  There is also typically an upgrade procedure to
bring a system from the previous formal release to the current one.
</p>

<p>
In short, if you're not the type of person who'd be willing to upgrade
your operating
system on a semi-daily basis, or if you want a system that is
relatively easy to install and upgrade, a formal release of NetBSD is
for you.
</p>

<h2>A history of formal releases</h2>

Thus far, there have been eleven formal releases of NetBSD.  Seven
releases were major releases, which introduce new features in the
operating system; and four were patch releases, which fix bugs in a
major release and improve its stablility.

We do not yet have a date planned for the next formal release; we will
ship no software before its time.
