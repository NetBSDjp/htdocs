We are pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.3.
<p>

Complete sources to NetBSD 1.3 are now available for download on one
of the sites listed below. Binary releases for all supported
architectures are either available for download now or will be made
available within a few days.
<p>

NetBSD 1.3 supports the following architectures:
<p>

<blockquote>alpha, amiga, arm32, atari, hp300, i386, mac68k, pc532, pmax,
sparc, sun3, sun3x, vax, x68k</blockquote>
<p>

<tt>What is NetBSD?<br>
---- -- ------</tt>
<p>

The NetBSD Operating System is a fully functional UN*X-like system
derived from the Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite,
and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.  NetBSD runs on many architectures and is
being ported to more.
<p>

NetBSD is freely distributable and fully source available.
<p>

NetBSD is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that this release wouldn't have come about.
<p>

The NetBSD 1.3 release is a landmark. Building upon the successful
NetBSD 1.2 release, we have provided numerous and significant
functional enhancements, including support for many new devices,
integration of many bug fixes, new and updated kernel subsystems, and
many userland enhancements.  The results of these improvements is a
stable operating system fit for production use that rivals most
commercially available systems.
<p>

Many thanks go to the NetBSD developers for making this release 
possible.
<p>

Even more thanks go to the many NetBSD users who have supported
NetBSD with their enthusiasm, evangelism, and contributions.
<p>

Enjoy!
<p>
