<h1>NetBSD/amiga 1.3</h1>

<p>
NetBSD/amiga 1.3 is the fourth <a href="../formal.html">formal release</a> of
<a href="../../Ports/amiga/">NetBSD/amiga</a>.
<br>
NetBSD 1.3.3 is a patch release which should be used in preference to
NetBSD 1.3.

<p>
Christian E. Hopps is the maintainer of NetBSD/amiga.

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p>
NetBSD/amiga 1.3 runs on any Amiga that has a 68020 or better CPU
with some form of MMU, and on 68060 DraCos.  For 68020 and 68030
systems, a FPU is recommended but not required.  68LC040, 68040V
and 68LC060 systems don't work correctly at the moment.
<p>
The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and about 75M of disk
space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space,
and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of
RAM will actually allow you to compile, however it won't be speedy. X
really isn't usable on a 4M system.)

<p> Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
<pre>
	partition:      advise, with X, needed, with X
	root (/)        20M     20M     15M     15M
	user (/usr)     95M     125M    75M     105M
	swap            ----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/usr/local)      up to you

</pre>

<p> As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is large
and bulky to accommodate all people).

<p> If you only have 4M of fast memory, you should make your swap partition
larger, as your system will be doing much more swapping.

<p>
If its not on the above lists, there is no support for it in this
release. Especially (but this is an incomplete list), there is no
driver for:

<ul>
        <li> Blizzard III SCSI option.
	<li> Cyberstorm Mk III SCSI option.
        <li> Ferret SCSI.
	<li> Oktagon SCSI.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2> Known problems with some hardware </h2>

<ul>

	<li><a name="bugs:emplant">The Emplant SCSI adapter</a>
	has been reported by a party to hang after doing part of
	the installation without problems.

	<li> <a name="bugs:cv643d">CV64/3d</a> is not used, if in
	a Zorro II machine. Experimental support for this mode is
	in the kernel sources, and you can try it by using ``option
	"CV3DONZORRO2"'' in your kernel configuration file when
	compiling your own custom kernel.


	<li> <a name="bugs:scsiscanner">SCSI scanner support</a>
	is machine independent, so it should work, but hasn't been
	tested yet on most Amiga configurations.  There are reports
	that the Mustek and HP Scanjet hang if accessed from the
	A3000. This might apply to other 33C93-Adapters, too.


	<li> <a name="bugs:floppy">Our floppy driver</a> doesn't
	notice when mounted floppies are write-protected at the
	moment. Your floppy will stay unchanged, but you might not
	notice that you didn't write anything due to the buffer
	cache. Also note that HD floppy drives only get detected
	as such if a HD floppy is inserted at boot time.
