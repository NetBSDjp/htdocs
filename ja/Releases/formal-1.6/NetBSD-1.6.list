<center><h1>Announcing NetBSD 1.6</h1></center>

The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that release 1.6 of the
NetBSD operating system is now available.
<p>

NetBSD is widely known as the most portable operating system in the
world.  It currently supports fifty two different system
architectures, all from a single source tree, and is always being
ported to more.
<p>

NetBSD 1.6 continues our long tradition with major improvements in
file system and memory management performance, major security
enhancements, and support for many new platforms and peripherals.
<p>

Complete source and binaries for NetBSD 1.6 are available for download
at many sites around the world.  A list of download sites via FTP,
AnonCVS, SUP, and other methods is provided at the end of this
announcement; the latest list of available download sites may also be
found at:  <a href="../../mirrors/">http://www.netbsd.org/mirrors/</a>
<p>

<em>Please note that ISO images will be made available shortly, and
will be bootable on several architectures.</em>
<p>

<h2>About NetBSD</h2>

    The NetBSD Operating System is a fully functional Open Source
    UNIX-like operating system derived from the University of
    California, Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite,
    and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.  NetBSD runs on fifty two different
    system architectures featuring seventeen machine architectures
    across eleven distinct CPU families, and is being ported to more.
    <p>

    The NetBSD 1.6 release contains complete binary releases for
    thirty nine different system architectures. The thirteen remaining
    are not fully supported at this time and are thus not part of the
    binary distribution. For information on them, please see the NetBSD
    web site at <URL>http://www.netbsd.org/
    <p>

    NetBSD is a highly integrated system.  In addition to its highly
    portable, high performance kernel, NetBSD features a complete set of
    user utilities, compilers for several languages, the X Window System,
    firewall software and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full
    source code.  We also support third party software (including the
    <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> and <a
    href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktops) through our package
    system.
    <p>

    NetBSD is free.  All of the code is under non-restrictive licenses,
    and may be used without paying royalties to anyone.  Free support
    services are available via our mailing lists and web site.  Commercial
    support is available from a variety of sources; some are listed at:

    NetBSD is the work of a <a href="../../People/">diverse group of
    people</a> spread around the world.  The `Net' in our name is a
    tribute to the Internet, which enables us to communicate and share
    code, and without which the project would not exist.

<h2>Major Changes Between 1.5 and 1.6</h2>

    It is difficult to completely summarize the extensive development
    between the 1.5 and 1.6 releases.  Some highlights include:
    <p>

    <h3>Kernel</h3>

    <ul>
	<li>Ports to new platforms including: algor, dreamcast, evbarm,
	    hpcarm, hpcsh, newsmips, sandpoint, sgimips, sun2, and walnut.
	<li>Unified Buffer Cache (UBC) removes size restriction of the file 
	    system's buffer cache to use all available RAM (if not otherwise 
	    used!) and improves overall system performance.</li>
	<li>Round-robin page colouring implemented for various ports for 
	    better cache utilisation, more deterministic run-time behaviour,
	    and faster program execution.</li>
	<li>A rewritten SCSI middle layer to provide a cleaner interface 
	    between the different kernel layers, including a kernel thread to
	    handle error recovery outside of the interrupt context. See
	    scsipi(9).</li>
	<li>A new pipe implementation with significantly higher performance
            due to lower overheads, which uses the UVM Page Loan facility.</li>
        <li>Linux binary emulation has been greatly improved with the
	    addition of arm, alpha, m68k and powerpc support, and now
	    supports kernel version 2.4.18.</li>
	<li>Booting from RAIDframe devices is now supported on some
	    ports.</li>
	<li>New boot loader flags <b>-v</b> (<i>bootverbose</i>) and
            <b>-q</b> (<i>bootquiet</i>), to be used by kernel code to 
	    optionally print information during boot.</li>
	<li>An in-kernel boot time device configuration manager userconf(4),
            activated with the <b>-c</b> boot loader flag.</li>
	<li>A work-in-progress snapshot of ACPI support, based on the 20010831
	    snapshot of the Intel ACPICA reference implementation.</li>
	<li>USB 2.0 support, in the form of a preliminary driver for the
            ehci(4) host controller.</li>
	<li>Basic kernel support for IrDA in the form of the irframe(4)
            IrDA frame level driver. Serial dongles and the oboe(4) driver
	    are currently supported.</li>
	<li>Kernel configuration files can be embedded into the kernel for 
	    later retrieval. Refer to <tt>INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE</tt> in
            options(4) for more information.</li>
	<li>Many more kernel tunable variables added to sysctl(8).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Networking</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Hardware assisted IPv4 TCP and UDP checksumming and caching of the
	    IPv6 TCP pseudo header. Support for checksum offloading on the 
	    DP83820 Gigabit Ethernet, 3Com 3c90xB, 3Com 3c90xC, and Alteon 
	    Tigon/Tigon2 Gigabit Ethernet cards.</li>
	<li>Zero-Copy for TCP and UDP transmit path achieved through page
	    loaning code for <b>sosend</b>().</li>
	<li>In-kernel ISDN support, from the ISDN4BSD project.</li>
	<li>802.1Q VLAN (virtual LAN) support. See vlan(4).</li>
        <li>IPFilter now supports IPv6 filtering.</li>
	<li>ndbootd(8) added; used to netboot NetBSD/sun2 machines.</li>
	<li>racoon(8) added; IKE key management daemon for IPsec key 
	    negotiation, from the KAME project.</li>
	<li>WEP encryption supported in ifconfig(8) and awi(4) driver.</li>
	<li>wi(4) and wiconfig(8) now support scanning for access points,
	    and defaults to BSS instead of ad-hoc mode.</li>
	<li>Bridging support; currently only for ethernet. See bridge(4).</li>
	<li>In-kernel PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) - RFC 2516, with much lower
	    overhead than user-land PPPoE clients. See pppoe(4).</li>
	<li>ifwatchd(8) added; invokes up-script and down-script when a 
	    network interface goes up and down. Used by pppoe(4).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>File Systems</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Enhanced stability of LFS version 2, the BSD log-structured
           file system.</li>
	<li>dump(8), dumpfs(8), fsck_ffs(8), fsirand(8), newfs(8), and
	    tunefs(8) support a <b>-F</b> option to manipulate file system 
	    images in regular files.</li>
	<li>makefs(8) added; creates file system images from a directory tree.
	    (Currently ffs only.)</li>
	<li>Enhanced <b>ffs_dirpref</b>() by Grigoriy Orlov, which noticeably
	    improves performance on FFS file systems when creating directories,
	    and subsequently manipulating them.</li>
	<li>Fixes for free block tracking and directory block allocation in 
	    FFS softdeps.</li>
	<li>Correctly support FFS file systems with a large number of cylinder
	    groups.</li>
	<li>Fix the endian independant FFS (FFS_EI) support.</li>
	<li>newfs(8) calculates default block size from the file system size,
	    and uses the largest possible cylinders/group (cpg) value if 
	    <b>-c</b> isn't given.</li>
	<li>dpti(4) driver added; an implementation of the DPT/Adaptec 
	    SCSI/I2O RAID management interface. Allows the use of the Linux 
	    versions of <b>dptmgr</b>, <b>raidutil</b>, <b>dptelog</b>,
	    (etc). </li>
	<li>Support for Windows 2000 'NTFS' (NTFS5, read-only).</li>
	<li>Tagged queueing support for SCSI drivers based on the ncr53c9x 
	    controller.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security</h3>

    <ul>
	<li>Addition of a chroot(8) hierarchy for services including named(8),
	    ntpd(8), and sshd(8).</li>
	<li>Additional passwd(5) ciphers: MD5, and DES with more encryption 
	    rounds. See passwd.conf(5).</li>
	<li>Several more code audits were performed.</li>
	<li><tt>/etc/security</tt> performs many more checks and is far more 
	    flexible in how it monitors changes. See security.conf(5).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>System administration and user tools</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>sushi(8) added; a menu based system administration tool.</li>
	<li>pgrep(1) and pkill(1) added; find or signal processes by name or
	    other attributes.</li>
	<li>System upgrades are made easier through the etcupdate(8) script
	    which helps updating the <tt>/etc</tt> config files interactively,
	    and the <tt>/etc/postinstall</tt> script which is provided to 
	    check for or fix configuration changes that have occurred in
	    NetBSD.</li>
	<li>stat(1) added; a user interface to the information returned by 
	    the stat(2) system call.</li>
	<li>BSD sort(1) replaces GNU sort(1).</li>
	<li>The "stop" operation for rc.d(8) scripts waits until the service
	    terminates before returning. This improves the reliability of
	    "restart" operations as well.</li>
	<li>Swap devices can be removed at system shutdown by enabling
	    <tt>swapoff</tt> in rc.conf(5).</li>
	<li>An optional watchdog timer which will terminate rc.shutdown(8)
	    after the number of seconds provided in <tt>rcshutdown_timeout</tt>
	    from rc.conf(5).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Support for multibyte LC_CTYPE locales has been integrated from 
	    the Citrus project. Many Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other 
	    encodings are now available.</li>
	<li>Full support for cross-compilation of the base system, even as a
	    non-root user! <tt>src/build.sh</tt> is available for doing
	    arbitrary cross-builds; see <tt>src/BUILDING</tt> for more 
	    information. At least 38 ports for the NetBSD 1.6 release were 
	    cross-built on a NetBSD/i386 system using this mechanism.</li>
	<li>Migrated the following CPU platforms to ELF: arm, and m68k 
	    (including amiga, hp300, mac68k, mvme68k, sun2, and x68k).</li>
	<li>Updates of most third party packages that are shipped in the base
	    system to the following latest stable releases:<br>
	    <dl>
	        <dd>- amd 6.0.6
		<dd>- BIND 8.3.3
		<dd>- binutils 2.11.2
		<dd>- bzip2 1.0.2

		<dd>- tcpdump 3.7.1
		<dd>- XFree86 4.2.0 (i386 only)
	    </dl>
        <li>Many new packages in <a
	    href="../../Documentation/software/packages.html">The NetBSD
	    packages collection</a>, including the latest open source
	    desktop <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE3</a>, <a
	    href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>, as well
	    as the latest <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>,
	    <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> and many more. At the
	    time of writing, there are over 3000 third party packages
	    available in pkgsrc.</li>
	<li>Added AGP GART driver agp(4) for faster access to graphics boards.
	    </li>
	<li>init(8) will create an mfs (memory based file system) <tt>/dev</tt>
	    if <tt>/dev/console</tt> is missing.</li>
	<li>vmstat(8) displays kernel hash statistics with <b>-H</b>
	    and <b>-h</b> <i>hash</i>.</li>
	<li>wscons(4) supports blanking of VGA consoles.</li>
    </ul>

    See the <a href="../../Changes/changes-1.6.html">list of
    significant changes between 1.5 and 1.6</a>.
    <p>

    And of course there have also been innumerable bug fixes and other
    miscellaneous enhancements.  Kernel interfaces have continued to be
    refined, and more subsystems and device drivers are shared among
    the different ports.  You can look for this trend to continue.
    <p>

    Please note that at the moment, sysinst will not assist you in
    installing pre-built third-party binary packages or the pkgsrc
    system itself. See the <a
    href="../../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD packages
    collection documentation</a>.
    <p>

    Lastly, it should be noted that the X11 binaries shipped in NetBSD
    1.6 for all ports except i386 are based on XFree86 version 3.3.6,
    while i386 is based on XFree86 verison 4.2.0. You may at compile
    time pick which sources to build and install. A snapshot of XFree86
    3.3.6 for i386 will be made available.
