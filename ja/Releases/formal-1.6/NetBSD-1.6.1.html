<h2>About NetBSD</h2>
 
    The NetBSD operating system is a full-featured, open source,
    UNIX-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Networking
    Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2.  NetBSD runs on
    52 different system architectures featuring 17 machine
    architectures across 11 distinct CPU families, and it being ported
    to more. The NetBSD 1.6.1 release contains complete binary releases
    for 40 different machine types.
    <p>

    NetBSD is a highly integrated system.  In addition to its highly
    portable, high performance kernel, NetBSD features a complete set of
    user utilities, compilers for several languages, the X Window System,
    firewall software and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full
    source code. <a
    href="../../Documentation/software/packages.html">The NetBSD Packages
    Collection</a> contains over 3500 packages and binary package
    releases for a number of platforms are currently in progress.
<!-- XXX: estimated time for popular arch bulk builds? -->

    NetBSD is the work of a diverse group of people spread around the
    world.  The `Net' in our name is a tribute to the Internet, which
    enables us to communicate and share code, and without which the
    project would not exist.

    <p>

    Please note that at the moment, sysinst will not assist you in

    collection documentation</a>.

    Lastly, it should be noted that the X11 binaries shipped in NetBSD
    1.6 for all ports except i386 are based on XFree86 version 3.3.6,
    while i386 is based on XFree86 verison 4.2.0. You may at compile
    time pick which sources to build and install. A snapshot of XFree86
    3.3.6 for i386 will be made available.
