    <title>About NetBSD 2.1</title>

    <para>NetBSD 2.1 is the first maintenance release of the 
    <ulink url="../release-map.html">netbsd-2</ulink> release branch.
    This release provides numerous functional enhancements, including
    support for many new devices, hundreds of bug fixes, patches
    and updates to kernel subsystems, and many enhancements to the
    user environment. In addition, all of the security fixes and
    critical bug fixes from the NetBSD 2.0.3 update are included as
    well.</para>
    <para>Complete source and binaries for NetBSD 2.1 are available
    for download at many sites around the world. A list of download
    sites providing FTP, AnonCVS, SUP, and other services is
    provided at the end of this announcement; the latest list of
    available download sites may also be found at:</para>

    <para>We encourage users who wish to install via a CD-ROM ISO
    image to download via BitTorrent by using the 
    <ulink url="../../mirrors/torrents/">torrent
    files</ulink> supplied in the ISO image area. BitTorrent has
    recently been added to the list of distribution mechanisms and
    its use is strongly encouraged to help keep bandwidth
    available.</para>

    <title>About NetBSD</title>

    <para>The NetBSD operating system is a full-featured, open
    source, UNIX-like operating system descended from the Berkeley
    Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2.
    NetBSD runs on 54 different system architectures featuring 17
    machine architectures across 17 distinct CPU families, and is
    being ported to more. The NetBSD 2.1 release contains complete
    binary releases for 48 different machine types.</para>
    <para>NetBSD is a highly integrated system. In addition to its
    highly portable, high performance kernel, NetBSD features a
    complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
    languages, the X Window System, firewall software and numerous
    other tools, all accompanied by full source code. The NetBSD
    Packages Collection contains over 5500 packages and binary
    package releases for a number of platforms are currently in
    progress.</para>
    <para>More information on the goals of the NetBSD Project can
    be procured from the NetBSD web site at:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/Goals/" />
    </blockquote>
    <para>NetBSD is free. All of the code is under non-restrictive
    licenses, and may be used without paying royalties to anyone.
    Free support services are available via our mailing lists and
    web site. Commercial support is available from a variety of
    sources; some are listed at:</para>

    <para>NetBSD is the work of a diverse group of people spread
    around the world. The 
    <quote>Net</quote> in our name is a tribute to the Internet,
    which enables us to communicate and share code, and without
    which the project would not exist.</para>
