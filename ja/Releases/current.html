<h1>NetBSD-current</h1>

<a href="../Releases/release-map.html"><b>NetBSD-current</b></a>
is a daily snapshot of the NetBSD development
source tree.  Because it is ``work in progress,'' it may not be
particularly well tested, and it may not even compile.  People
developing drivers and other system-level software for NetBSD are
encouraged to run NetBSD-current, as are people who want to be on the
bleeding edge of NetBSD development.  If you're just using NetBSD for
day-to-day work, you should probably be running a
<a href="formal.html">formal release of NetBSD</a> instead.
<p>

When incompatible changes to the kernel/userland-interface
are made, the centiversion is incremented (1.5A, 1.5B, etc.).
Hopefully, a carefully worked out upgrade path is published on
the current-users mailing list. (This is why you <em>must</em>
read this mailing list, if you are running NetBSD-current).

<h2>Why do something like NetBSD-current?</h2>

The developers of NetBSD have made the current development sources
available to the public for several reasons.  Overall, providing
NetBSD-current helps us to create a more stable, accessible system.
<p>

We want it to be easy for
people to become involved in the development of NetBSD.  Distributing
the current development sources makes becoming involved easier,
because it allows a greater number of people to see where the system
is going.
It also makes changes from users easier to integrate; if users make
changes against the current development
sources, then virtually no integration is needed to get them into the
master source tree.
<p>

We also want people to test the software as
we're developing it.  Users of NetBSD-current are encouraged to send
in <a href="../Misc/send-pr.html">bug reports</a> about the current
sources, and that helps us find and fix bugs.  Because people are
testing the software soon after it's written, more bugs can be found
and eliminated.
<p>

People who use NetBSD-current may also want to find out
the <a href="../Misc/query-pr.html">state of the bug reports</a>.
This allows a user to track the progress of a bug report they 
submitted or even look for bugs to fix.

<h2>How does one track NetBSD-current?</h2>

You should be aware that NetBSD-current is not necessarily
stable; often, new bugs are introduced when new features are
added, and we don't even claim that the current sources will
<em>compile</em> on any given day.  Your mileage may vary.
