<h1>Information about NetBSD 1.1</h1>

NetBSD 1.1 was the fourth release of the NetBSD operating system.
<p>

NetBSD 1.1 was released on November 26, 1995.
It is an evolutionary release which contains over a year of
changes to the kernel, user-level utilities, and documentation.
<p>

Continuing the multi-platform tradition, NetBSD had added ports to
atari and mvme68k based machines.  Kernel interfaces continued to
be refined, and several subsystems and device drivers were shared
among the different ports.  This trend continued in later releases.
<p>

NetBSD 1.1 had significantly enhanced the binary emulation subsystem 
(which included iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4, Solaris and Ultrix
compatibility at that point) and several kernel subsystems had been
generalized to support these enhancements more readily.  The binary
emulation strategy was (and still is) aimed at making the emulation
as accurate as possible.
<p>

NetBSD 1.1 was also the first release to see machine-independent disk
striping.  The concatenated disk driver (ccd), which was previously
supported only by the hp300 port, had been vastly improved.  Many
bugs were fixed, and explicit references to device-dependent routines
removed and replaced by calls to the generic "vnode operation"
routines.  In addition, several features were added, including partition
support, dynamic configuration and unconfiguration via a user space system
utility program, and virtually unlimited number of component devices.
<p>

Many new user programs were added in NetBSD 1.1, as well,
bringing it closer to our goal of supplying a complete UN*X-like
environment.
