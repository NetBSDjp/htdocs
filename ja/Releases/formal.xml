<title>NetBSD Formal Releases</title>
</head>

<sect1 id="formal-releases">

<para>
<ulink url="../Releases/release-map.html">Formal releases of NetBSD</ulink>
are intended to provide a stable, supported
platform on which people can base their work.  They provide a balance
between features and stability.  They are also typically easier to
install than <ulink url="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
A release is done by creating a branch of the source tree.
The branch is known as e.g. 1.6_BETAn, and binary snapshots for all
ports are autobuilt daily for test purposes. After a first test
of the release building tools has been done, it is frozen; that
is, no more features may be added, and bug fixes may only be added
by&mdash;or on consent of&mdash;the release engineer. The branch is known
as RCn when it is stable enough to be considered a release candidate,
and the final release will be eg. NetBSD-1.6.
</para>

<para>
During this time, many developers concentrate on testing the
release branch. Problems found on the release branch are fixed and
tested on the development branch, and fixes pulled up to the release
branch. The <ulink url="../releng/">Release engineering status page</ulink>
has information about the status of upcoming releases.
</para>

<sect1 id="why-formal">
<title>Why use a formal release?</title>

<para>
Because they are well-tested and made relatively infrequently, formal
releases are useful for people who don't want to be on the <quote>bleeding
edge</quote> of development, or who just want to run applications.
Since formal releases are effectively unchanging (there are typically
very few official patches made to them), they are
relatively easy to support, both by NetBSD's developers and the
developers of applications.  The biggest problem with running the
latest formal release of NetBSD is that you don't have access
to the latest features and bug fixes in the development tree.
</para>

<para>
Formal releases are relatively easy to install.  All of the platforms
supported by a formal release come with a detailed set of installation
instructions, and most also include some sort of bootstrapping media.
(For example, the i386 port typically uses floppy disk images to
bootstrap, while the amiga and hp300 ports use a miniroot filesystem
image.)  There is also typically an upgrade procedure to
bring a system from the previous formal release to the current one.
</para>

<para>
In short, if you're not the type of person who'd be willing to upgrade
your operating system on a semi-daily basis, or if you want a system
that is relatively easy to install and upgrade, a formal release of
NetBSD is for you.
</para>

<sect1 id="how-formal">
<title>How to obtain updates for formal releases</title>

<para>
For those who do not wish to wait for the next release, we have daily
updated snapshots of the release branches available via both FTP and SUP.
</para>

<para>
The directories <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-2-0/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-2-0</ulink>
and <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-3-0/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-3-0</ulink>
contain the extracted sources plus weekly updated tar files of both the 2.0
and 3.0 release branches respectively.
These files are created in a similar manner to those in the <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current</ulink>
directory.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="history">
<title>A history of formal releases</title>

<para>
Thus far, there have been 25 formal releases of NetBSD.  Eleven releases
were major releases, which introduced new features in the operating
system; and 14 were patch releases, which fix bugs in a major release
and improve its stablility.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="current-formal">
<title><ulink name="current"></ulink>Currently supported releases</title>

<!-- Update numbers in previous paragraph when there are new formal
     or patch releases -->

<para>
The NetBSD 3.0, 2.0 and 1.6 branches are currently being maintained. The
NetBSD 1.5 and older branches have reached End Of Life and are no
longer supported.
</para>
