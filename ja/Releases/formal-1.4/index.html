<h2>Major changes between 1.4.1 and 1.4.2</h2>

<ul>

  <li>A driver for the Alteon Gigabit Ethernet cards has been added,
      see <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=ti&amp;sect=4">ti(4)</a>.

  <li>A driver for the Realtek 8129/8239 Fast Ethernet PCI cards have
      been added, see <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=rl&amp;sect=4">rl(4)</a>.

  <li>A driver for the DPT SmartCache and SmartRAID III or IV SCSI
      adapters has been added, see <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=dpt&amp;sect=4">dpt(4)</a>.

  <li>A driver for the BOCA IOAT66 6-port ISA serial adapter has been
      addedl, see <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=ioat&amp;sect=4">ioat(4)</a>.

  <li>Support for the X-surf Amiga board has been added.

  <li>Support for ext2fs revision 1, with read-only support for the
      ``sparse super'' and the ``filetype'' options has been added.
      See <a
      href="http://www.feyrer.de/NetBSD/ext2fs-rev1.html">Hubert
      Feyrer's page on these extensions</a> for more information.

  <li>BIND has been upgraded to version 8.2.2-P5.

  <li>The IPF packet filtering software has been upgraded to version
      3.3.5.

  <li>Tcpdump now can do hex/ascii dumps of packet contents.  See <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=tcpdump&amp;sect=8">tcpdump(8)</a>. 

  <li>An implementation of the System V user management utilities has
      been added.

  <li>The name ``errno'' is now always a macro which expands to a
      function call.  This is done to ease the integration of thread
      libraries with the code in both system and third-party
      libraries.  Please include <tt>&lt;errno.h&gt;</tt> to access
      the correct definition of ``errno''.

  <li>A utility for making temporary files for shell scripts has been
      added, see <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=mktemp&amp;sect=1">mktemp(1)</a>.

  <li>The automounter utility <a
      href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=amd&amp;sect=8">amd(8)</a> has been updated to fix a security problem.

  <li>A security problem in procfs has been fixed.  Procfs is not used
      by default in NetBSD.

  <li>The floating point emulation on the ports using the m68k CPU has
      been reverted to the version in NetBSD 1.4, because the version
      in NetBSD 1.4.1 had problems.

  <li>Several subsystems has received substantial work, such as
      RAIDframe, LFS and the package tools.

</ul>

The <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.4.2/CHANGES-1.4.2">CHANGES-1.4.2</a>
file contains the complete list of changes applied in NetBSD 1.4.2.

<h2>Major changes between 1.4 and 1.4.1</h2>

<ul>

  <li>The NetBSD/alpha port's compatibility for Digital UNIX / Tru64
      has been greatly improved.

  <li>Many bug fixes and improvements of the installation tools and
      utilities.

  <li>Support for more PCI serial/parallel cards has been added.

  <li>The floating point emulation on the ports using the m68k CPU has
      been upgraded.

  <li>A fatal problem with </tt>/dev/random</tt> has been found and
      fixed.

  <li>Support for Alpha 21264 ev6 based systems has been added to
      NetBSD/alpha.

</ul>

file contains the complete list of changes applied in NetBSD 1.4.1.

<h2>Major changes between 1.3 and 1.4</h2>

      It is impossible to completely summarize the nearly two years of
      development that went into the NetBSD 1.4 release. Some
      highlights include: 
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
	Substantial improvements in the TCP/IP implementation, including
	numerous performance enhancements and bug fixes by Jason
	Thorpe and others.

  <li>
	A new, high efficiency kernel memory pool allocator by Paul
	Kranenburg. This has been integrated into most kernel
	subsystems.

  <li>
	A new, totally rewritten virtual memory subsystem, UVM, created by
	Chuck Cranor, which is substantially cleaner and better performing
	than the old Mach derived VM subsystem.

  <li>Improved POSIX and XPG standards compliance.

  <li>Completion of the integration of all remaining 4.4BSD Lite-2 kernel
      improvements and bug fixes that had not been previously integrated.
      (Integration of all userland components was completed before
      NetBSD 1.3)

  <li>Several new ports, including macppc, bebox, sparc64, next68k, and
      others, have been integrated into the source tree.

  <li>
	The system compilers have been upgraded to egcs 1.1.1, and the
	system compiler toolchain now (mostly) uses the latest
	versions of GNU binutils instead of the obsolete versions left
	over from 4.4BSD Lite.

  <li>
	Everyone's favorite <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=ftp&amp;sect=1">ftp(1)</a>
	client has been improved even further. See the man page for
	details.

  <li>A new architecture independent console driver, <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=wscons&amp;sect=4">wscons(4)</a>, has been
      integrated into many ports.

  <li>Numerous improvements have been made to the audio subsystem support,
      including support for MIDI device drivers.

  <li>Linux compatibility support has been improved.

  <li>A number of scheduler enhancements have yielded dramatic improvements
      in interactive performance and better control of background tasks.

  <li>Several network tunneling protocols, including GRE and IP in IP, have
      been implemented.

  <li>Kernel support for the CODA distributed file system has been added.

  <li>Manuel Bouyer completed major changes to the IDE support.  It is now
      architecture independent. Major changes have been made to the IDE
      code for better error handling, improved ATAPI support, 32 bit data
      I/O support and bus-master DMA support on PCI IDE controllers.

  <li>Lennart Augustsson has added full USB support, permitting the use of
      a wide variety of Universal Serial Bus peripherals. The drivers
      should easily port to any future platforms that support the PCI bus.
      See <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=usb&amp;sect=4">usb(4)</a> for an overview.

  <li>RAIDframe, version 1.1, from the Parallel Data Laboratory at Carnegie
      Mellon University, has been integrated.  Supports RAID levels 0, 1,
      4, 5, and more.

  <li>Luke Mewburn added <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=nsswitch.conf&amp;sect=5">nsswitch.conf(5)</a> functionality to the system to
      specify the search order for system databases.

  <li><a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=syslogd&amp;sect=8">syslogd(8)</a> now supports listening on multiple sockets, to make the
      chrooting of servers easier.

  <li>Most third party packages have been updated to the latest stable release.
</ul>
<p>
As has been noted, there have also been innumerable bug fixes.
Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems and
device drivers are shared among the different ports. You can look for
this trend to continue.
