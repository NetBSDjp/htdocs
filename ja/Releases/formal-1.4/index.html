<h1>Information about NetBSD 1.4.x</h1>

NetBSD 1.4 is the seventh release of the NetBSD operating system, and was
released on May 12, 1999.

<p>

The latest patch release, 
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.4.1/index.html">NetBSD 1.4.1</a>, 
was released on August 26, 1999. It fixed bugs and added new hardware support.
It is recommended that users upgrade where possible. A list of the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.4.1/CHANGES-1.4.1">changes</a>
 for 1.4.1 is available. There is also a list of important

<p>
The NetBSD 1.4 release engineering team would like to thank the
literally hundreds of contributors who made this release a reality. We
would also like to thank our users, who have supported NetBSD with
their enthusiasm, evangelism, and contributions.
<p>
      It is impossible to completely summarize the nearly two years of
      development that went into the NetBSD 1.4 release. Some
      highlights include: 
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
	Substantial improvements in the TCP/IP implementation, including
	numerous performance enhancements and bug fixes by Jason
	Thorpe and others.

  <li>
	A new, high efficiency kernel memory pool allocator by Paul
	Kranenburg. This has been integrated into most kernel
	subsystems.

  <li>
	A new, totally rewritten virtual memory subsystem, UVM, created by
	Chuck Cranor, which is substantially cleaner and better performing
	than the old Mach derived VM subsystem.

  <li>Improved POSIX and XPG standards compliance.

  <li>Completion of the integration of all remaining 4.4BSD Lite-2 kernel
      improvements and bug fixes that had not been previously integrated.
      (Integration of all userland components was completed before
      NetBSD 1.3)

  <li>Several new ports, including macppc, bebox, sparc64, next68k, and
      others, have been integrated into the source tree.

  <li>
	The system compilers have been upgraded to egcs 1.1.1, and the
	system compiler toolchain now (mostly) uses the latest
	versions of GNU binutils instead of the obsolete versions left
	over from 4.4BSD Lite.

  <li>
	Everyone's favorite <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=ftp&amp;sect=1">ftp(1)</a>
	client has been improved even further. See the man page for
	details.

  <li>A new architecture independent console driver, <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=wscons&amp;sect=4">wscons(4)</a>, has been
      integrated into many ports.

  <li>Numerous improvements have been made to the audio subsystem support,
      including support for MIDI device drivers.

  <li>Linux compatibility support has been improved.

  <li>A number of scheduler enhancements have yielded dramatic improvements
      in interactive performance and better control of background tasks.

  <li>Several network tunneling protocols, including GRE and IP in IP, have
      been implemented.

  <li>Kernel support for the CODA distributed file system has been added.

  <li>Manuel Bouyer completed major changes to the IDE support.  It is now
      architecture independent. Major changes have been made to the IDE
      code for better error handling, improved ATAPI support, 32 bit data
      I/O support and bus-master DMA support on PCI IDE controllers.

  <li>Lennart Augustsson has added full USB support, permitting the use of
      a wide variety of Universal Serial Bus peripherals. The drivers
      should easily port to any future platforms that support the PCI bus.
      See <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=usb&amp;sect=4">usb(4)</a> for an overview.

  <li>RAIDframe, version 1.1, from the Parallel Data Laboratory at Carnegie
      Mellon University, has been integrated.  Supports RAID levels 0, 1,
      4, 5, and more.

  <li>Luke Mewburn added <a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=nsswitch.conf&amp;sect=5">nsswitch.conf(5)</a> functionality to the system to
      specify the search order for system databases.

  <li><a href="http://www.flame.org/cgi-bin/uncgi/hman?page=syslogd&amp;sect=8">syslogd(8)</a> now supports listening on multiple sockets, to make the
      chrooting of servers easier.

  <li>Most third party packages have been updated to the latest stable release.
</ul>
<p>
As has been noted, there have also been innumerable bug fixes.
Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems and
device drivers are shared among the different ports. You can look for
this trend to continue.
