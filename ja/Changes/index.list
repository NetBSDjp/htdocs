<DATE>isdn4bsd-0.83 30 Jul 1999 - isdn4bsd 0.83 beta released
    A new isdn4bsd beta version (i4b-00.83.00-beta-300799.tar.gz) has been
    made available on the <a href="ftp://i4b.consol.de/pub">isdn4bsd
    distribution site</a>.<p>

    Isdn4bsd (or in short i4b) is a package for interfacing a
    computer running FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD or BSD/OS to the
    ISDN. Supported NetBSD architectures are NetBSD/Alpha,
    NetBSD/Amiga, NetBSD/Atari and NetBSD/i386.<p>

    The only ISDN protocol currently supported is the BRI protocol
    specified in I.430, Q.921 and Q.931; better known as DSS1 or
    Euro-ISDN.<p>

    Isdn4bsd allows you to make IP network connections by using
    either IP packets sent in raw HDLC frames on the B channel or
    by using built-in synchronous PPP.<p>

    For telephony, isdn4bsd can answer incoming phone calls like
    an answering machine and now has preliminary dialout capabilities
    for voice and data calls.<p>

    Bugfixes, enhancements, erratas and addons (if any) will be made
    available at <a href="http://www.freebsd-support.de/i4b/">this site</a>.

    The <a href="../Ports/i386/">i386</a> port has switched to using
    <a href="../Documentation/elf.html">ELF</a> as its default loader
    format.

<DATE>ip6 1 Jul 1999 - Integration of IPv6 support from KAME
    NetBSD now supports the emerging standard for IP version 6, AKA
    IPng.  Code for this was imported from the <a
    href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME Project</a>.  To enable IPv6,
    compile a kernel from the GENERIC.v6 config file, or include
    "options INET6" for the bare minimum IPv6 support.  For a listing
    of new programs available with this code integration, see the KAME
    web site.

<DATE>ev6 29 Jun 1999 - New generation of EV6 systems now supported by NetBSD/alpha
    NetBSD/alpha now supports the new generation of systems based on
    the 21264 CPU.  Supported systems now include the 264DP, XP1000,
    DS20, and others.  This work was supported by <a
    href="http://www.alpha-processor.com/"> Alpha Processor, Inc</a>.

<DATE>netbsd-release 28 Jun 1999 - NetBSD release branch available via FTP and SUP.
    We are glad to announce that the NetBSD project now offers a daily
    updated snapshot of the current NetBSD release sources.  This is
    currently the `netbsd-1-4' branch.
    <p>
    The directory <a
    href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release/">ftp.netbsd.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release</a>
    contains the extracted sources plus weekly updated tar files.
    these files are created in a similar manner to those in the <a
    href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current</a>
    directory.
    <p>
    A new sup collection called `release' has been created.  inside
    this new collection are the same SUP releases you can find in the
    `current' collection, excluding the `doc', `pkgsrc' and `xsrc' SUP
    releases, as these source have not in the past been branched for a
    NetBSD release.
    <p>
    The <a
    href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/doc/README.sup">doc/README.sup</a>
    file has been updated accordingly.
    <p>
    Please report any problems you see with the FTP or SUP server.
    (note that for a short time after the normal overnight update the
    SUP server was using the `release' files for the `current'
    collection, but this has been recitified).

<DATE>cvschanges 23 Jun 1999 - CVS changes in HTML format
    The last nine months of CVS change mail-archives are now
    automatically indexed by month and module/tag and processed
    into a set of <a href="cvschanges/index.html">html</a> pages.

<DATE>new-sun3-portmaster 23 Jun 1999 - New sun3 portmaster
    Nathan Williams takes over from Gordon Ross, who was the <a
    href="../Ports/sun3/index.html">sun3</a> port maintainer for
    several years. We would like to thank Gordon for all the work he
    has contributed to the project through his very long and productive
    tenure.
    <p>
    Jeremy Cooper will remain in his current position as maintainer of code
    related to the sun3x architecture.
    <p>
    Let's all welcome the new port maintainer and wish him good luck, and a
    lot of patience! :-)

<DATE>usenix-99 6 Jun 1999 - Usenix '99
    There is a <a href="../gallery/reports/usenix-1999.html">full report</a>
    of the NetBSD feedback recived during the 1999 USENIX Annual Technical
    Conference.

<DATE>sa1999-010 21 May 1999 - 1.3* ARP table DOS Security Advisory
The implementation of ARP packet reception in NetBSD 1.3* is vulnerable
two attacks:
<p>
<ol>
<li>On multihomed hosts, ARP packets from cable A can overwrite ARP
    entries for cable B.
<li>For all hosts, ARP packets can overwrite ARP entries marked as static.
</ol>
<p>
For more details, please see the <a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/misc/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA1999-010.txt.asc">security
advisory</a>.

<DATE>user-groups-listing 21 May 1999 - User groups listing added
We've only just started compiling <a href="../gallery/groups.html">this
list</a>, so bear with us. The intention is to make this a valuable
resouce for any NetBSD user looking for other local NetBSD people.

<DATE>hypersparc-support 20 May 1999 - Hypersparc support in NetBSD/sparc
Paul Kranenburg has made some changes today that should allow
Hypersparc machines to operate correctly in -current <a
href="../Ports/sparc/index.html">NetBSD/sparc</a>.
<p>
Hypersparcs have a VIPT cache, which means that to flush a page from
the cache a virtual-to-physical translation is done to do the cache tag
comparison.  This will cause an entry to appear in the MMU's TLB.  So,
when removing or changing mappings, doing a cache flush after clearing
entries from the TLB may cause spurious TLB entries causing funny
effects in your programs.  Some pmap functions had the cache and TLB
flush operation in the wrong order.
<p>
He is looking into providing the necessary patches to enable hypersparc
support in NetBSD 1.4.1.

<DATE>allocsys 20 May 1999 - MI allocsys() and BUFCACHE on all ports
Luke Mewburn has made `allocsys()' machine independent. Additional
benefits include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Printing out system memory sizes consistently uses
a new kernel function - format_bytes() (which uses another new function;
humanize_number()) to display the info.
<li>all ports should now support the <code>BUFCACHE</code> option
(see options(4)).
</ul>

<DATE>kame_snap_199905 17 May 1999 - KAME experimental snapshot supports NetBSD-1.4
KAME is a project doing IPv6 and IPsec work on *BSDs.
From now on, NetBSD-1.4 is supported in the KAME kits.
<p>
Their packages are free of charge but have absolutely no warranty.
Experimental snapshots are available at
ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/snap/, every Monday.  Please visit <a
href="http://www.kame.net/">the KAME web pages</a> for details.

<DATE>netbsd-1.4 12 May 1999 - NetBSD 1.4 released
We are pleased to announce release 1.4 of the NetBSD Operating System,
a complete and fully functional Open Source Unix-like OS.
<p>
NetBSD runs on twenty different system architectures featuring eight
distinct families of CPUs, and is being ported to more.
<p>
For more details please see the <a href="../Releases/formal-1.4/index.html">
formal release page</a>

<DATE>hypercom-parallel 10 May 1999 - HyperCom 3+/4+ parallel port support
The lpt-clone parallel ports on the HyperCom 3+/4+ boards are supported
in NetBSD/Amiga - current.  People using NetBSD/Amiga 1.4 can add
support for this by applying a <code>hypercom-parallel-patch</code> patch
file to their kernel sources, and rebuilding. [<i>This patch has been
merged into the 1.4.1 release.</i>]

<DATE>pool-diagnostic-helpers 10 May 1999 - Pool allocator diagnostic helpers
I've made some changes to the pool allocator which will aid in tracking
down problems with memory allocation...
<p>
I've added a "show pool" command to DDB, which dumps fairly complete
information about a pool.  Two modifiers ara available: /p (show page
headers) and /l (show log).
<p>
Logging is now enabled on a per-pool basis, so if you only need to track
allocations and frees on the mclpool, you can do that by making a change to
the pool_init() call that passes PR_LOGGING.  You can enable logging on all
pools by using the kernel option POOL_DIAGNOSTIC.
<p>
Pool logging now also works on pools that are not pool_create()'d, but
rather just pool_init()'d.  If the pool_init() call is made too early to use
malloc(), logging is disabled automatically.
<p>
I've also changed the ABI somewhat; file and line indicators are now ALWAYS
passed to pool_get(), pool_put(), and pool_reclaim().  These are used to
perform reentrancy checking and logging.  Logging and reentrancy checking are
available if DIAGNOSTIC is defined.  The file and line info are always passed
for the benefit of LKMs, etc.

<DATE>isdn4bsd-00.80 08 May 1999 - isdn4bsd-00.80.00-beta publicly available
<p>
A new isdn4bsd beta version (i4b-00.80.00-beta-070599.tar.gz) has been made
available on the isdn4bsd distribution sites.
<p>
Many bugs - especially some fat ones causing occasional reboots without
panic messages - have been fixed.
<p>
Some enhancements were made and some features were added.
<p>  
Support for <a href="../Ports/i386/index.html">NetBSD/i386-1.4</a>,
<a href="../Ports/amiga/index.html">NetBSD/Amiga-1.4</a>, <a
href="../Ports/atari/index.html">NetBSD/Atari-1.4</a> and limited
support for NetBSD/i386-1.3.3 is available.  Drivers for several PCI,
ISA, ISAPNP, PCMCIA and ZBUS boards are included.  Only the European
protocol suite is supported in this test release.
<p> 
For more information on isdn4bsd, please read the file README in the isdn4bsd
base directory.
<p>  
For NetBSD installation instructions, please read the file INSTALLATION in the
NetBSD directory.
<p>
The ISDN4BSD package is available from <a
href="ftp://isdn4bsd@ftp.consol.de/pub/">isdn4bsd@ftp.consol.de/pub</a>.
You have to log in as user <em>isdn4bsd</em> and give your email
address as the password. Then change to the <code>pub</code>
directory.  Anonymous ftp as user <em>ftp</em> or <em>anonymous</em>
will <em>NOT(!)</em> work!

<DATE>macppc-usb-keyboard 06 May 1999 - macppc USB keyboard works without kludge
I have committed all of the changes necessary for the iMac and new G3
to attach the USB keyboard properly, without the need for a source
modification in a local tree.  It all happens based on what the
OpenFirmware says the console input device is.
<p>
This also fixes ADB keyboard support on the new G3.  ADB keyboard support
should work just fine on older PowerMacs, too, but we're going to test
an 8500 and a 7300 RSN.
<p>
I've asked that these all be pulled into the release branch, so that
1.4 (i.e. the CD being given away at USENIX!) will support these systems.
<p>
I think Charles Hannum is hoping to demo an iMac running NetBSD in the
NetBSD vendor booth at USENIX!  So this was the source of some of the
development push :-)
<p>
Thanks lots to Bill Studenmund for testing the spew of patches that
came flying into his mailbox, and thanks Tsubai for catching some of
the glitches in my Bandit changes :-)
<p>
FWIW, the test system has been a new G3.  PCI IDE works great, and there's
also a BusLogic BT-958 SCSI in it, which also works fine :-)
<p>

<DATE>compat_osf1-enhancements 05 May 1999 - COMPAT_OSF1 enhancements
In post-NetBSD 1.4-branch NetBSD-current, <a
href="../Ports/alpha/index.html">NetBSD/alpha</a> has much improved
OSF/1 (a.k.a. Digital UNIX, a.k.a. Tru64 UNIX) emulation, including
support for dynamically linked binaries.
<p>
Of note, the following applications are known to work to the extent
that they have been tested:
<p>
<table>
<tr><th align=left>Application and Version</th>
    <th align=left>Digital UNIX Env. Version</th></tr>
<tr><td>Navigator 4.08</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Navigator 4.51</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Navigator 4.51</td><td>4.0E</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/GMVHome.html">
	General Mesh Viewer</a> (decMesa variant)</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
(Java and Javascript even appear to work, in Navigator!)
<p>
I expect that earlier versions of those applications, for earlier
versions of the Digital UNIX (or DEC OSF/1) environment, will function
with little or no effort but (not having them 8-) I couldn't verify
that.
<p>
Once NetBSD-current reverts back to the 'trunk' of the development
sources (after 1.4 is released), this will be available to you all as
part of NetBSD-current.
<p>
If you're not interested in running NetBSD-current, and instead want
to run the upcoming NetBSD 1.4 release, I have prepared a set of
patches to the 1.4 sources which integrate the functionality into
NetBSD 1.4.  If you're interested in getting the patches and are
willing to provide me feedback about what you're testing with them and
how well it works, please send me e-mail.

1.3.1 to their product called "<a
href="http://www.brains.co.jp/eng-ver/e-mmeye/mmeye.html">mmEye</a>".  mmEye has
100MHz SH3 CPU, video capturing device, two PCMCIA slots (one for ATA
flash memory and one for network - usually Ethernet) and works as
web-camera device. The company has kindly decided to donate the code to
NetBSD project, and several volunteers are working locally on cleanups
and to catch up to NetBSD-current.  After that they hope to merge the
code into the NetBSD repository.  There is also a <a
href="http://www2.kame.net/~itojun/netbsd-sh3/">NetBSD/sh3 mailing
list</a>.

<DATE>new_mvme68k_portmaster 15 Feb 1999 - New mvme68k portmaster
Steve Woodford is taking over as the port-master for the mvme68k
port.  Steve has built the past few releases and is working on
adding support for new equipment, and I'm sure he'll continue to
do a great job in that area.
The previous portmaster, Chuck Cranor, will be focusing his efforts
on UVM, but will still be around to help out with the mvme68k port
as needed.

<DATE>danish_bsd_group 10 Feb 1999 - Danish *BSD user group formed

  After a year of development, the latest release of the NRL IPv6+IPsec
software is now available to the public. As the name suggests, this software is
an implementation of IP Version 6 and IP Security (separately and together).
<p>
  This version supports:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>BSD/OS 4.0 on x86 (supplements our code previously merged into 4.0)
    <li>OpenBSD 2.3 and 2.4 on x86 and sparc (a more integrated version of this
      release is now in OpenBSD's CVS tree; you need userland from this kit)
    <li>NetBSD 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 on x86 and sparc
    <li>FreeBSD 3.0 on x86
    <li>Linux 2.1 on x86 (for PF_KEY only)
</ul>
<p>
  This release adds a lot of ports, updates the code to conform to newer
versions of many specs (which effectively meant rewriting portions of the
code), and includes a lot of general cleanups and improvements.

<DATE>netbsd_sparc64 23 Jan 1999 - NetBSD/sparc64 on Sun UltraSPARC
The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce the availability of a port to
Sun UltraSPARC hardware. <a
href="../Ports/sparc64/index.html">NetBSD/sparc64</a> is the product of
a 2-year volunteer effort by Eduardo Horvath, along with assistance
from the following people (in no particular order):
<ul>
    <li>Matthew Green (32-bit emulation, other miscellaneous help)
    <li>Paul Kranenburg (machine-independent SBUS drivers)
    <li>Chuck Cranor (VM-related issues)
    <li>Chris Demetriou (miscellaneous good suggestions)
    <li>Jason Thorpe (driver interface issues)
</ul>
Currently supported hardware:
<ul>
    <li>UltraSPARC I and II CPUs
    <li>esp SCSI controllers
    <li>le ethernet controllers
    <li>zs serial ports
    <li>cgsix graphics controllers
</ul>
Any of the other drivers from the <a
href="../Ports/sparc/index.html">NetBSD/sparc</a> port might also
work.
<p>
Presently, NetBSD/sparc64 supports certain Ultra platforms with the
devices listed above.  The 32-bit kernel runs most NetBSD/sparc binaries.
A 64-bit version of the system currently exists and runs on some
hardware, but requires further development to be fully functional.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks go to Eduardo for his hard work and perseverance.  We look
forward to continued development of this exciting new port!

<DATE>scheduler_fixes 23 Jan 1999 - Scheduler fixes
Compiling a program while trying to use X resulted in the mouse repeatedly
freezing for a moment, then coming back to life.
<p>
This was due to the problem discussed on tech-kern using the highly
technical designation ``sucky performance''. :-);  for more details see the
mail from <a

<DATE>netbsd_1.3.3 23 Dec 1998 - NetBSD 1.3.3 Released
<p>
The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.3.3.
<p>
This release fixes a substantial number of bugs found in the 1.3.x
family of releases, including security issues.  We urge users on the
Internet to upgrade their systems.
<p>
It includes significant new or updated features, such as an updated
FTP client and updated package tools, and updates our version of the X
Window System from XFree86 release 3.3.2 to XFree86 3.3.3.
<p>
Finally, it also includes a somewhat improved installation procedure
for multiple ports.
<p>
The <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.3/">release
binaries and source</a> are available now, and can be found on <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.3/MIRRORS">mirror

<DATE>new_vax_snapshot 02 Dec 1998 - New VAX snapshot
<ul>
<li>Dynamic linked libraries
<li>EGCS as native C compiler
<li>UVM as new memory management system
<li>Improved support for VS3100's
<li>X client programs precompiled
</ul>
and a bunch of other stuff.
<p>
The install files is in <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/vax/snapshot/19981201/binary/sets/">pub/NetBSD/arch/vax/snapshot/19981201/binary/sets/</a>
on ftp.netbsd.org. I will also provide a new improved install system
(using sysinst) in the nearest weeks, but it isn't working OK on all
systems yet. This will supersede the old install system with copy and
edlabel; and extract everything from the disk instead.
<p>
Many thanks to Matt Thomas, who wrote the shared libraries and EGCS
support for <a href="../Ports/vax/index.html">NetBSD/VAX</a>.
<p>
The long-time-wanted support for SCSI on VS3100 is also closing up:
Jens A Nilsson got tired of not having this so he wrote PIO
support for it. He will probably in the near future also finish DMA
support, anyway, some SCSI will be in the install kernels when I upload them.
<p>
Note: A complete installation _will_ fit on a RD54 (I tried :-)

<DATE>raidframe 11 Nov 1998 - RAIDframe integrated
Greg Oster has just added RAIDframe version 1.1 to the NetBSD kernel.
<a href="http://www.pdl.cs.cmu.edu/RAIDframe/">RAIDframe</a>, from the
Parallel Data Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University, is a framework
for rapid prototyping of RAID structures, and includes both a RAID
simulator and a device driver for a limited number of architectures.
The RAIDframe device driver in NetBSD-current is a full RAID
implementation, including levels 0, 1, 4, 5, hot spares, and more, and
is available for all NetBSD platforms.  The base code for RAID level 6,
parity logging, and a number of other features is present in the
driver, but requires additional testing and debugging.  For more
details, see Greg's <a

<li>Version in-tree: egcs 1.1b release with NetBSD bug-fixes and kprintf
attribute additions
<li>Now the default compiler on alpha, sparc, and i386.
<li>Confirmed working on ns32k and powerpc.
</ul>

<DATE>gre 13 Sep 1998 - Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) implementation
<p>
This is a very alpha implementation of GRE packet encapsulation.
Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) is described in RFC 1701 and 1702.
The interface also supports IPIP (protocol 4) encapsulation,
as described in RFC 2003 but default is GRE mode.
</p><p>
Basically GRE allows to tunnel not only IP over IP, but also provides
for other protocols like Appletalk etc. Cisco routers do their multicast
tunnels over GRE (1). The hope is, that with GRE encapsulation, a method
is found to encapsulate all other protocols with one mechanism and reduce
the need for own tunneling in ip_mroute etc.

<DATE>uvm_switch 02 Sep 1998 - bebox, macppc, ofppc, and pc532 switch to UVM
The three powerpc based NetSBD ports, and the pc532 have switched over to
<a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a> virtual
memory system.
<ul>
<li>BeBox (<a href="../Ports/bebox/index.html">bebox</a>).
<li>NS32532 based pc532 (<a href="../Ports/pc532/index.html">pc532</a>).
<li>Power Macintosh (<a href="../Ports/macppc/index.html">macppc</a>).
<li>OpenFirmware based powerpc (<a href="../Ports/ofppc/index.html">ofppc</a>).
</ul>
With these additions we now have fourteen ports using <strong>UVM</strong>, and
all but one of the remaining ports can run with <strong>UVM</strong> as an
option. The next major release of NetBSD should feature <strong>UVM</strong>
across the board.

<DATE>daemon_news 01 Sep 1998 - First issue of Daemon News

<DATE>new_www.netbsd.org 31 Aug 1998 - www.netbsd.org switches to new machine
www.netbsd.org has been switched from a '486 to a Pentium II machine,
and also moved to UPS power, thus providing faster and (hopefully)
more reliable service.

<DATE>uvm_improvements 31 Aug 1998 - UVM improvements, plus i386 and arm32 switch
<p>
<a href="../Ports/i386/index.html">NetBSD/i386</a> and <a
href="../Ports/arm32/index.html">NetBSD/arm32</a> have switched over to
the new <a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a> virtual
memory system.
</p>
<p>
Over the last few days, Jason Thorpe has been making some improvements
to the way UVM allocates some of its data structures. On the Alpha and
MIPS platforms, many UVM data structures are now mapped via the KSEG,
which will avoid TLB thrashing on these platforms.  On others, many
structures are now mapped via the kernel_map, instead of the kmem_map,
which means that the kmem_map is a lot less likely to suffer a resource
shortage.
</p>
<p>
These changes now make it possible for UVM to run on large memory x86
systems without additional tweaks to default parameters (a similar
problem existed to a lesser extent on mac68k systems, as well).
Because this problem is now fixed, I have switched the x86 port to use
UVM+PMAP_NEW by default.
</p>

<DATE>mail_archives 27 Aug 1998 - Searchable and browsable mail archives
All the NetBSD mail lists are now searchable at <a

add their site.

<DATE>new_source_changes_format 07 Aug 1998 - New format of source-changes
A long standing bugbear has been the somewhat unhelpful format of the
source-changes list (which records all changes to the NetBSD source trees).
The format has now been changed to compact multiple-directory commits into one
message. A hypothetical example of the new output would look like:

<DATE>4front_oss 12 Jul 1998 - 4Front releases Open Sound System
OSS provides sound card drivers for most popular sound cards 
under NetBSD. These drivers support digital audio, MIDI, Synthesizers 
and mixers found on sound cards. These sound drivers comply with the 
Open Sound System API specification.<br>

<DATE>usb 13 Jul 1998 - NetBSD is first to support USB

<p>
NetBSD-current is now the first free operating system to support the Universal
Serial Bus.
</p>

<h4>Supported Now</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>A UHCI (the Intel standard) host controller driver.</li>
<li>A OHCI (everyone else's standard) host controller driver.</li>
<li>A host controller independent framework for handling the
    devices.  This framework presents a mostly USBDI compliant
    interface to the drivers.</li>
<li>Power budgeting.</li>
<li>A hub driver.</li>
<li>A mouse driver.</li>
<li>A keyboard driver for keyboards supporting the boot protocol.</li>
<li>A generic HID (Human Interface Device) driver for
    those devices that do not have a special driver.</li>
<li>A printer driver.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Work in Progress</h4>

<ul>
<li>Support for all kinds of transfers (control, interrupt, bulk,
    and isochronous).</li>
<li>Bandwidth budgeting.</li>
<li>A totally generic driver to handle leftover devices.</li>
<li>An audio driver.</li>
</ul>

<!--
	What we don't have:
	- Proper handling of devices that are disconnected.  NetBSD lacks
	  the functionality for this.
	- Suspend/resume handling.  I think this is simply a matter of
	  sitting down and writing some code.
	- A communication class driver.
	- Drivers for a lot of proprietary devices.
	- Loadable device drivers.

<DATE>new_alpha_snapshot 06 Jul 1998 - New alpha support and snapshot

<p>
There is a new snapshot available on ftp.netbsd.org and on the mirror sites.
This is a complete snapshot, with X, an updated toolchain source module,
and instructions. The toolchain binaries are merged into the standard sets
as with 1.3.2.
</p>

<h4>Complete snapshot</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>includes an updated toolchain, incorporating binutils 2.8.1,
    the strip(1) bug is fixed, nicer as(1), etc.</li>
<li>includes X: <em>xbase.tgz, xfont.tgz, xcomp.tgz, xserver.tgz,
    xcontrib.tgz</em></li>
<li>includes installation instructions</li>
<li>Available at:
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/snapshot/19980628/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/snapshot/19980628/</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Many new platforms</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>AlphaServer 4100   <em>(Rawhide)</em></li>
<li>AlphaServer 1000   <em>(Mikasa, Mikasa+Pinnacle)</em></li>
<li>AlphaServer 1000A  <em>(Noritake, Noritake+Pinnacle, Corelle)</em></li>
<li>ALPHABook 1                       <em>(AlphaBook 1)</em></li>
<li>Digital Personal Workstation (550) <em>(Miata)</em></li>
<li>EB66</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In some cases this support is at a rather experimental stage.
We would really appreciate it if people with access to any of
these systems would try the new snapshot, or at least boot the
floppy and see what happens. Other systems with systypes in the
above list--like the Alphaserver 800--should also be working now.
</p>

<p>
Support for the 4100 is not on the install floppy, but if you have
one we will be happy to make a floppy for you.
</p>

<h4>Other -current features</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>PCMCIA</li>
<li><a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a>.  This is
    the first release with the userland compiled for UVM and with a
    UVM INSTALL and GENERIC kernel, featuring clustered pageout,
    faster image startup, and other performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Things to look out for</h4>

<p>
The X server hasn't been tested, and is probably temporarily broken
due to currently active framebuffer console development. I expect
this will be fixed shortly. The bootfloppy still doesn't support
the turbochannel systems.
</p>

<p>
As usual, don't try to update userland and expect to boot an old
kernel.
</p>

<h4>TURBOchannel-based Alphas</h4>
A boot floppy for TURBOchannel <a
href="../Ports/alpha/index.html">Alphas</a> with keyboard support is
available.  This would be usable for maintenance. A kernel image with
keyboard and mouse support is also available. With these, you can
install the latest snapshot without serial console.  See:  <a

<DATE>pciide 15 Jun 1998 - Improved IDE support for NetBSD/i386
Manuel Bouyer has ported the work done to the ide system for netbsd-current
in the bouyer-ide branch back to 1.3.2. This adds support for isapnp, pcmcia
and pci IDE controllers (with DMA and ultra-DMA/33 support, and also supports
the 2 channels on the CMD 0640), and ATAPI floppy drives (such as Iomega ZIP
or LS120).  It's available from:
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/ide-1.3.2/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/ide-1.3.2/</a>

<DATE>next68k 09 Jun 1998 - next68k port added
It's still very "experimental," but it does now netboot and run with a
serial port console well enough to compile itself.  There is no support
for the scsi disk, keyboard, display or other NeXT "extras" yet.
<a href="../Ports/next68k/index.html">NetBSD/next68k homepage</a>

<DATE>netbsd-1.3.2 29 May 1998 - NetBSD 1.3.2 released

<p>
The NetBSD project is pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.3.2.
</p>

<p>
This release fixes bugs found in the 1.3 and 1.3.1 releases --
including recently discovered security holes in BIND and other
software.  We urge users on the Internet to upgrade their systems.
</p>

<p>
This release also updates our version of The X Window System from
XFree86 release 3.3.1 to XFree86 3.3.2, with security patches.
</p>

<p>
The release binaries and source are in the usual location, at:
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.2/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.2/</a>
</p>

<p>
For a list of changes since 1.3.1 (not including X and purely
installation-related changes), see:
<a href="../Releases/formal-1.3/changes-1.3.2.html">http://www.netbsd.org/Releases/formal-1.3/changes-1.3.2.html</a>
</p>

<DATE>alpha_ipnat_floppy 26 May 1998 - alpha news, IPNAT and floppy support

<h4>IPNAT</h4>

<p>
The 64-bit bugs with ipnat have been fixed and patches and instructions
can be found in:
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/ipnatfix/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/ipnatfix/</a>
</p>

<p>
An example ipnat startup might look like this. For de0 and de1, say,
and if both are already ifconfig'ed:
<pre>	sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
	ipf -E
	ipnat -f /etc/ipnat.conf
	dhcpd de1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The contents of ipnat.conf:
<pre>	map de0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32 portmap tcp/udp 1024:65535
	map de0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32
</pre>
</p>

<h4>GENERIC FLOPPY</h4>

<p>
A floppy that boots up a fairly recent 1.3E GENERIC kernel is now available in:
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/genfloppy">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/genfloppy</a>
</p>

<p>
Note that this is the first floppy that supports the TURBOchannel alphas.
I hope to also have a ramdisk INSTALL floppy for the 3000/xxx systems soon,
but this one should make installs possible given a DHCP or BOOTP server
and an NFS root with the base set installed.

<DATE>macppc 18 May 1998 - PowerMacintosh port committed to NetBSD-current

<p>
It runs on (at least) PowerMac 7300, 8600, 9500, and 9600.
</p>

<h4>Supported devices</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>on-board 53c9x SCSI</li>
<li>MACE ethernet</li>
<li>serial ports</li>
<li>ADB keyboard and mouse</li>
<li>NE2000 compatible ethernet</li>
<li>3c905 ethernet</li>

</p>

<h4>Devices <em>not</em> supported</h4>

<p><ul>
<li>on-board MESH SCSI</li>
<li>floppy disk</li>
<li>audio</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Additional considerations</h4>
<p>
Currently <a href="../Ports/macppc/index.html">NetBSD/macppc</a> uses
linuxppc's milo for primary boot, but it is not included in source tree
because of GPL.  Tsubai Masanari is planning on rewriting it shortly.

<DATE>network_hippi 15 May 1998 - Changes to network code, timestamps and HIPPI

<ul>
<p>
<li><p>Monotonically increasing "current time" timestamps have been
    added to the fast and slow timeout dispatch routines.  These
    can be used to implement network timers which compare "current
    time" against "when timer will expire", which can can reduce
    read/modify/write/compare/branch cycles to read/compare/branch,
    or used for time-ordered timeout queues.  TCP timers and the SYN
    cache timers now use this PRT timer facility, which has resulted
    in much less expensive timer expiration loops.

<p>
Covalent Technologies, Inc. is pleased to announce a way to add secure
SSL transaction services to your Apache web server.
</p>

<p>
The Raven SSL module is now available for the NetBSD operating system.
Raven provides SSLv2 and SSLv3 secure communication services using
RSA licensed cryptography algorithms. Raven is easily added to an
Apache web server via the highly flexible Apache module API.

<DATE>more_uvm 03 May 1998 - alpha, hp300, mac68k, mvme68k, and sparc switch to UVM
	
<p>
NetBSD/hp300, NetBSD/mac68k, and NetBSD/mvme68k have switched over
to the new <a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a> virtual
memory system.
</p>

<p>
Hats off to all the folks who worked on UVM to make it happen:
first and foremost, Chuck Cranor, who designed and implemented UVM,
Matthew Green, who handled integration issues and wrote the swap
subsystem, and Chuck Silvers, who wrote the anonymous memory pager
(which added support for shared memory).
