<a href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2003/03/01/0000.html">his
mail to the current-users MailingList</a>), making available the various <a
href="http://xfree86.org/4.3.0/RELNOTES.html">improvements and
enhancements</a> in this version of XFree86 to NetBSD.  Please note that at
this point in time only NetBSD/i386 is tested.  Also note that the <a
href="../releng/releng-1.6.html">upcoming 1.6.1 release</a> will still be
shipped with XFree86 4.2.1, as the 4.3.0 release needs to be tested and
stabilized first.

<DATE>binutils-2.13 28 Feb 2003 - latest binutils imported into -current
As part of updating the toolchain, Matthew Green has imported the latest
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/">GNU binutils</a> (2.13.2.1)
into -current. The new binutils adds support for hppa and x86_64,
improved support for existing architectures and is known to work for
almost all CPU types NetBSD currently supports. Updates of gdb and gcc
will follow.

<DATE>topdown 21 Feb 2003 - New ``topdown'' uvm in -current
Andrew Brown has committed changes to <a
href="../Documentation/current/index.html">-current</a> implementing a new
``topdown'' <a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">uvm</a>.  With these
changes, the areas for heap growth and mmap(2)'ed allocations, which used to
be separate, are now one and the same, allowing either one to grow much larger
than before. As an example, on i386 it is now possible to mmap(2) over 2GB of
memory!  Furthermore, the work leading up to this has already dramatically
reduced the number of entries in the kernel's map.
<br><br>
At the moment, this option is available for the <a
href="../Ports/i386/">i386</a>, <a href="../Ports/macppc/">macppc</a>, <a
href="../Ports/prep/">prep</a> and the PowerPC OEA based ports, but
particularly ports with small amounts of virtual memory such as the <a
href="../Ports/acorn26/">acorn26</a> benefit from these changes.
<br><br>
For more details, please see the thread starting with Andrew's posting to the
<a
href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2003/02/20/0020.html">current-users
MailingList</a>.

<DATE>pkgsrc-1-6-1 13 Feb 2003 - pkgsrc branched for 1.6.1 release
Alistair Crooks has created the pkgsrc-1-6-1 branch from -current to
correspond with the upcoming release of <a
href="../releng/releng-1.6.html">NetBSD 1.6.1</a>. Like the previous
pkgsrc-1-6 branch, this branch provides a stable, known working set of
packages which will have only security and build fixes applied. It is
intended for systems where stability is preferred over bleeding-edge
packages, and also for slower systems which can find it difficult to
keep up with the flux of pkgsrc-current.
<p>
A few highlights of this branch are:
<p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/pkgsrc/www/mozilla/README.html">mozilla 1.2.1</a></li>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/pkgsrc/www/phoenix/README.html">phoenix 0.5</a></li>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/pkgsrc/x11/kde3/README.html">KDE 3.0.5.1</a></li>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/pkgsrc/graphics/mplayer/README.html">mplayer 0.90rc3</a></li>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/pkgsrc/www/apache/README.html">apache 1.3.27</a></li>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/pkgsrc/www/apache2/README.html">apache 2.0.44</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
To check out the branch with anoncvs, run
<blockquote>
<pre>
cvs checkout -rnetbsd-1-6-1 pkgsrc
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
See <a href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">The NetBSD
Packages Collection documentation</a> for more information.
<p>
Please note that <em>this branch is separate from the 1.6 pkgsrc
branch</em>, as there have been some large structural improvements
since that time.

<DATE>ata-raid-support 30 Jan 2003 - Experimental support for ATA RAID volumes
Jason R Thorpe has checked in some experimental support for RAID volumes found
on ATA "RAID" controllers. These controllers are just IDE controllers with a 
BIOS that can configure RAID volumes, write config blocks to the disks, and do 
I/O to the volumes, for the purpose of booting.  The OS has to implement the RAID
in software, using the configuration data that is written to the disks by the BIOS.
<br><br>

<DATE>branch-161 30 Jan 2003 - NetBSD 1.6.1 release process has begun
The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that NetBSD 1.6.1 has been tagged
and the release engineering process has begun.  NetBSD 1.6.1 is a maintenance
(or <em>patch</em>) release for users of NetBSD 1.6, not to be confused with
<a href="../Documentation/current/">NetBSD-current</a> (which will become the
next major release).  As a patch release, it will not be branched off the head of
the CVS source tree, but instead includes all security fixes and patches
applied to the 1.6 branch.
<br><br>
A complete list of changes since 1.6 is available in src/doc/CHANGES-1.6.1 of
the branch, which can be checked out by passing the
<code>-rnetbsd-1-6-PATCH001-RC1</code> flag to the cvs command: <code>cvs
co -rnetbsd-1-6-PATCH001-RC1 src</code>.
<br><br>
Details on the release cycle and status information is available from <a
href="../releng/releng-1.6.html">http://www.NetBSD.org/releng/releng-1.6.html</a>.  

<DATE>de-book-1-6 29 Jan 2003 - German NetBSD 1.6 book now available
German publisher C&amp;L has made available a <a
href="http://www.cul.de/netbsd.html">NetBSD 1.6 book</a>, covering

<DATE>merge-nathanw_sa 17 Jan 2003 - nathanw_sa branch merged with -current
Jason Thorpe has merged the nathanw_sa branch with -current. NetBSD
now has a high performance, modern kernel thread implementation using
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/nathanw/www/usenix/">Scheduler
Activations</a> in the main source tree. This work was performed by
Nathan Williams with contributions by several other developers.

<br><br>
While NetBSD has supported symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) on a number of
systems for some time now, native kernel-assisted threads are another big
step forward:

<br><br>
SMP provides system-level parallelism; multiple independent processes
can run concurrently on different CPUs.

<br><br>
Multi-threading provides application-level parallelism; multiple threads
within the same process can run concurrently on different CPUs; concurrency
requires kernel support for threads, which is what Scheduler Activations
provides.

<br><br>
Many applications today use a threaded software architecture (rather than
the traditional Unix model of multiple cooperating independent processes),
and so having an efficient threads implementation is an important goal of
the NetBSD project.

<br><br>
Scheduler Activations is an efficient method of mapping N userland threads
to M kernel threads which avoids both the concurrency problems of N:1
implementations and the scalability problems of 1:1 implementations.

<br><br>
With native threads now available in NetBSD-current, applications from
pkgsrc will readily pick it up upon rebuild, and things will be fixed over
the coming time.

<br><br>
For instructions on how to port existing applications and to use threads
in your own programs using the new libpthreads that comes with NetBSD now,
see <a
href="http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/">http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/</a>.


<DATE>merge-nathanw_sa-plan 15 Jan 2003 - Merge plan for nathanw_sa branch
Jason Thorpe has announced a plan for the long anticipated merging of the
nathanw_sa branch with -current.  The <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/nathanw/www/usenix/">nathanw_sa
branch</a> implements scheduler activations and provides native support for
pthreads.  The vast majority of the work on this branch has been done by
Nathan Williams.  Please see <a

If you use -current with userland newer than 2002/08/26, please
update your kernel to most current sources ASAP.

A serious security issue was fixed in sys/kern/exec_elf32.c rev.
1.77. The bug used to allow any local user to run arbitrary code as
root via a dynamic suid/sgid binary.

Neither 1.6 branch, nor anything older is affected by this.  Static
suid/sgid programs are not affected by this either.

<DATE>veriexec_021029 30 Oct 2002 - Verified exec added to -current
Brett Lymn has added verified exec to -current, which verifies a
cryptographic hash before allowing execution of binaries and scripts.
As the name implies, verified exec compares the hash of a file against
its previously defined hash and execution is only allowed if the hash
matches.
<p>
This can be used to prevent a system from running binaries or scripts
which have been illegally modified or installed. Verified exec can also
be used to limit the use of script interpreters to authorized scripts
only and disallow interactive use.

<DATE>kqueue_merged 23 Oct 2002 - kqueue branch merged with -current
Jaromir Dolecek has
<a href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2002/10/23/0050.html">merged
the kqueue branch</a> with -current.
<p>
kqueue provides a stateful and efficient event notification framework.
Currently supported events include socket, file, directory, fifo,
pipe, tty and device changes, and monitoring of processes and signals.
<p>
kqueue is supported by all writable filesystems in the NetBSD tree
(with the exception of Coda) and all device drivers supporting poll(2).
<p>
It is based on work by Jonathan Lemon for FreeBSD. The initial NetBSD
porting work was performed by Luke Mewburn and Jason Thorpe.

<DATE>irix-article-020922 22 Sep 2002 - Article Series: IRIX Binary Compatibility, Part 3
<A href="http://www.onlamp.com/">ONLamp.com</a> has published the third
part of Emmanuel Dreyfus's ``<a
href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2002/09/12/irix.html">IRIX Binary
Compatibility</a>'' article series.  In this part, Emmanuel explores a few IRIX
oddities. This includes the loading of shared libraries, which has been
implemented inside the IRIX kernel in order to improve performances. In order
to correctly execute dynamic IRIX binaries, the NetBSD kernel needs to
implement the same feature.
<p>
It seems there is no documentation about the way this optimization works,
therefore some reverse engineering has been necessary. This part of the IRIX
binary compatibility on NetBSD series explains how gdb(1), nm(1) and
objdump(1) were used to fully understand the mechanisms involved with IRIX
dynamic linking.

<DATE>eol-1.4 22 Sep 2002 - End-of-life declaration of NetBSD 1.4 branch
In keeping with NetBSD's policy of maintaining only the current and
most recent release, the release of NetBSD 1.6 marks the end-of-life
for NetBSD 1.4.  This means that no more pullups are made to the netbsd-1-4
branch and no more security advisories are issued.  The NetBSD Project
strongly recommends that users of NetBSD 1.4 update their systems.

<DATE>hp-testdrive-020917 17 Sep 2002 - HP test drive sporting NetBSD 1.6

        (*) reissue   (x) affects 1.5.3   (+) affects 1.6
    </pre>
    <p>
    These advisories involve bugs in libc (affecting static binaries), as
    well as the kernel.  A full system rebuild is recommended to
    collectively address all of these issues, but please make sure to read
    through all of the advisories in case specific issues affect your
    system.
    <p>
    Because of the extensive rebuild required, the NetBSD 1.6 release was
    delayed in order to include fixes for as many of these issues as
    possible, so as to provide binary release users with an easy upgrade
    path.
    <p>
    Readers will note that there are some gaps in the above numbering.
    These pending advisories involve third parties, and are awaiting
    disclosure co-ordination, so we cannot publish them at this time.
    However, they <em>are</em> fixed in NetBSD 1.6.
    <p>
    Unfortunately, the recent 1.5.3 release was affected by most of these
    issues. Unlike NetBSD 1.6, the 1.5 branch cannot be automatically
    cross-built to release, and so any updated binary release from the 1.5
    tree will take considerable time and developer effort.
    <p>
    Therefore:
    <ul>
     <li> The recommended cumulative fix for pre-1.6 systems is to upgrade
     to NetBSD 1.6. </li>
     <li>Users who cannot upgrade to 1.6 are recommended to update to the
       most recent sources on the NetBSD-1.5 branch, via anoncvs, and
       rebuild from there.</li>
     <li>Users of NetBSD-current should upgrade to source more recent than
       September 11, 2002, and rebuild the kernel and all userland.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Having updated the base NetBSD distribution via one of the above, the
    following steps are necessary for <em>all</em> users:
    <ul>
     <li>Recompile statically-linked binaries from pkgsrc, or custom builds (for
	 2002-006)</li>
     <li>Remove any shared libraries with older major numbers. (2002-006)</li>
     <li>Remove any shared libraries for OS emulation under /emul, unless you 
	 are sure it has no security vulnerabilities. (2002-006)</li>
     <li>Follow instructions in 2002-018</li>
    </ul>

Jason Thorpe has committed code to NetBSD-current that implements the new
dmover(9) kernel API for accesssing hardware-assisted data movers.  This
allows the kernel to use hardware which can fill regions of memory, copy
regions of memory, and perform operations (such as XOR) on multiple regions of
memory.  More information is available in his <a

<DATE>securitynote-020801 1 Aug 2002 - NetBSD users not affected by OpenSSH ftp site trojan
<p>
Some users have expressed concern over the reported installation of a
trojan in the OpenSSH distribution files on one of the official OpenSSH
ftp sites. 
<p>
NetBSD will not be issuing a security advisory on this matter. Our
basesrc and pkgsrc OpenSSH distributions were not affected, and the
NetBSD ftp mirror sites never held copies of the compromised files.
<p>
pkgsrc users would be protected by the SHA1 hash test performed on any
retrieved distfile. Only users who manually downloaded the affected file
and compiled manually, or edited their pkgsrc Makefile _and_ told pkgsrc
to ignore the package SHA1 hash could be affected by the issue described
here:  <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/advisories/ssh_trojan.txt">http://www.openbsd.org/advisories/ssh_trojan.txt</a>

<DATE>libc-signal-trampoline 10 Jul 2002 - Switch to a signal trampoline provided by libc
Jason Thorpe has committed code to NetBSD-current to switch to signal
trampolines provided by libc, instead of
copying them on the user stack and executing them there.
The kernel  will provide one for backward compatibility, and for emulations.
This will allow marking stack pages as non-executable, which
will prevent buffer overflows from executing random code provided
by exploits. 

<DATE>newsuperh-020708 08 Jul 2002 - Support for the SuperH(tm) SH-5 CPU Architecture Added
Steve Woodford, on behalf of Wasabi Systems, has begun

the release engineering process has begun.  For details on the release process
and on where to obtain snapshots, please see <a
href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2002/05/28/0004.html">Todd
Vierlings post</a> to the current-users Mailinglist.  The proposed release
timetable in a best case scenario is roughly as follows:

<p>
<pre>
COMPLETE STEPS:
         
May 22          ** Feature cutoff -- no new feature or 3RDPARTY pullups **
 \              ** after this point **
         
May 22-         Create netbsd-1-6 branch, name kernel version 1.6_BETA1.
 \              (Increment trunk to 1.6A.)
         
**       
         
IN PROCESS STEPS:

  \      
   \            Build 1.6_BETA1 snapshots daily; fix compilation bugs.
    \           Test 1.6_BETA1 binaries (including installers).
     \          Portmaster-delegated builder preps X sets for platforms with
June 2          X servers.

(Note that _BETA1 is slightly longer than should be for a _BETA phase, but
this is to give a little leeway to shake out the new structure.  Typically
_BETA cycles should be 7 days.)

June 2          ** Critical pullup cutoff - only security, build, sysinst **
 \              ** and other release critical pullups after this point **

June 3-         Make kernel version 1.6_BETA2.
 \              Build 1.6_BETA2 snapshots daily; fix compilation bugs.
  \             Test 1.6_BETA2 binaries (including installers).
   \
    \           If there were any X11 pullups in _BETA1, the
June 9          portmaster-delegated builder rebuilds X sets.

[7 days]        Optional additional _BETAn cycle(s) as determined by releng;
                these will slide the following dates accordingly.


June 10-        Tag 1.6_RC1.  Build binaries and X sets once.  Test.
June 13

[4 days]        Optional additional _RCn cycle(s) as determined by releng;
                these will slide the following dates accordingly.

June 14         Tag 1.6.  Rebuild base sets for new kernel version.  (X sets
                should propagate as-is from a prior build.)

June 15-        Set up distribution tree; factor out shareable tarballs;
 \              create distribution global doc (CHANGES, etc.) files.
  \
June 18         Open 1.6 to mirrors.

June 19         Open 1.6 to the world and announce it.

June 19-        Begin open-ended phase before 1.6.1 release cycle.
</pre>

<DATE>bcrypt-password-020524 24 May 2002 - bcrypt password entry support in -current

Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino has added support for
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html>bcrypt password</A>
entry to <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.
It will provide more attack-resistant password store, and can be enabled
via passwd.conf(5).
The code was originally developed by Niels Provos for OpenBSD.

<DATE>tcp-zerocopy-020502 2 May 2002 - Experimental zero-copy for TCP and UDP transmit-side in -current
 
Jason R. Thorpe has recently added experimental code to <a
href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>, that enables zero-copy for
TCP and UDP on the transmit-side.  These changes could mean significant
performance improvements for FTP, WWW, and Samba servers.  See Jason's <a
href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2002/05/02/0016.html">announcement</a>
to the current-users mailing list for details.

<DATE>ipfilter-020502 2 May 2002 - IPFilter upgraded to 3.4.27 in -current
<p>
Martti Kuparinen has upgraded IPFilter to the latest version (3.4.27) in 
<a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.
<p>
In order to use the new version, update your NetBSD-current source tree, 
recompile your kernel and recompile the userland IPFilter tools. For 
example, to rebuild the userland part:
<blockquote><tt>
cd /usr/src/sys && make includes<br>
cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/ipf && make dependall install
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
After rebooting a new kernel with IPFilter 3.4.27 enabled, you should see
<blockquote><tt>
IP Filter: v3.4.27 initialized.  Default = pass all, Logging = enabled
</tt></blockquote>
in your boot messages.
<p>
If you have any problems with it, please report them with send-pr(1).

<DATE>mvmeppc-port-020303 3 Mar 2002 - NetBSD Ported to Motorola MVME PowerPC Boards
    NetBSD/mvmeppc is a new port of NetBSD to the <a
    href="http://www.motorola.com/">Motorola</a> <a
    href="http://mcg.motorola.com/cfm/templates/category.cfm?subCatID=2">MVME PowerPC</a>
    Single Board Computers.
    <p>
    This was made possible through a donation by Gan Starling of two
    (plus one loaner) MVME160x boards so that a porting effort could be made.
	<p>
	Due to NetBSD's highly portable architecture, the operating system was
	up and running multi-user after just two weeks worth of part-time effort.
	<p>
	A NetBSD/mvmeppc specific
    <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/subscribe_list.pl?list=port-mvmeppc">mailing list</a>
	has been set up for people to
	discuss any issues with running NetBSD on their MVME PowerPC boards,
	and a <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/mvmeppc/snapshot/20020302">snapshot of NetBSD/mvmeppc</a>
	is also available for anyone wishing to experiment with the new port.

<DATE>hp300-snap-020224 24 Feb 2002 - New install media for hp300

The last bits to the new hp300 install media have been completed by
<a href="mailto:g.mcgarry@ieee.org">Gregory McGarry</a>.
The list of goodies include:

<ul>
<li>bootblocks supporting bootp
<li>ramdisk kernels
<li>sysinst
</ul>

<p>
Please try the kernel at
ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/gmcgarry/hp300/sysinst/install.gz

<p>
This kernel includes the new console attachment code, hil interface,
rtc attachment and softintr framework.  It has been tested on a 340
with 4MB of RAM!  But sysinst is known not to work with such little
RAM.

<DATE>simh-vax-emulator 21 Feb 2002 - NetBSD/vax now runs in an emulator

The Computer History Simulation Project

is a loose Internet-based collective of people interested in restoring
historically significant computer hardware and software systems by simulation.
Recently

Managed to install NetBSD/vax into the emulator.  He has posted
<a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/Ports/vax/emulator-howto.html">detailed
instructions</a> explaining how to duplicate this.


<DATE>openoffice 20 Feb 2002 - OpenOffice available for NetBSD

Michael Rauch has worked hard to get OpenOffice working on NetBSD, and
a package is now available in <PKGSRC>misc/openoffice. The package was
tested on NetBSD 1.5.3_ALPHA and -current. As Java (Version 2 - JDK
1.3 or newer) is needed to build OpenOffice, this currently limits the
list of platforms to i386. When current Java implementations start
becoming available for other NetBSD platforms, it is expected that
OpenOffice will appear on these platforms as well.
<p>

OpenOffice is the Open Source version of the StarOffice office
application suite. Its mission statement is to create the leading
international office suite, running on all major platforms and
providing access to all functionality and data through open-component
based APIs and an XML-based file format.
<p>

To build OpenOffice.org version 641 from source, update pkgsrc and then
type "make install" in <PKGSRC>misc/openoffice.  A binary package compiled for
NetBSD 1.5.3_ALPHA/i386 with XFree 4.2.0 is available as
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.5/i386/All/openoffice-641.tgz">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.5/i386/All/openoffice-641.tgz</a>. As
the NetBSD 1.5.x releases are binary-compatible, this binary package
will also install and run fine on any NetBSD/i386 1.5-based machine.
If you experience any problems, please report them in the usual way
via send-pr.
<p>

More information on OpenOffice.org is available at
<a href="http://www.OpenOffice.org/">http://www.OpenOffice.org/</a>,

<DATE>ipfilter-020127 27 Jan 2002 - IPFilter upgraded to 3.4.23 in -current
<p>
Martti Kuparinen has upgraded IPFilter to the latest version (3.4.23) in 
<a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>. This version supports
IPv6. If IPFilter is enabled at boot time (by putting <tt>ipfilter=YES</tt> 
in /etc/rc.conf), then IPv4 filtering rules are read from /etc/ipf.conf and 
IPv6 filtering rules are read from /etc/ipf6.conf.
<p>
In order to use the new version, update your NetBSD-current source tree, 
recompile your kernel and recompile the userland IPFilter tools. For 
example, to rebuild the userland part:
<blockquote><tt>
cd /usr/src/sys && make includes<br>
cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/ipf && make dependall install
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
After rebooting a new kernel with IPFilter 3.4.23 enabled, you should see
<blockquote><tt>
IP Filter: v3.4.23 initialized.  Default = pass all, Logging = enabled
</tt></blockquote>
in your boot messages.
<p>
The new version has been tested on i386 and sparc64 systems. If you have 
any problems with it, please report them with send-pr(1).

<DATE>syspkgs-020126 26 Jan 2002 - NetBSD System Packages supported in -current
<p>
Jim Wise has committed changes to 
<a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a> for a 
packaging system for the NetBSD base install. This will
allow for binary components of the NetBSD base system to be easily
installed, removed and upgraded. It is hoped that these changes will 
be included in the next major release of NetBSD.
<p>
For example, it will be possible to cleanly remove large
components (e.g. the compilers, named(8), sendmail(8), etc) from 
a NetBSD system without affecting system integrity. It allows the
user to have a finer control over what is installed on their
system. Security updates and bug fixes can now be provided as 
package upgrades, which will make maintaining NetBSD systems 
a lot easier.
<p>
For more information about the system, see
<CURRENTSRC>/distrib/syspkg/notes/NOTES or in distrib/syspkg/notes
in an up to date NetBSD-current source tree.

<DATE>xfree-4.2 26 Jan 2002 - XFree86 v4.2.0 imported into NetBSD xsrc tree
<p>
Matthias Scheler has imported the latest 
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> release
(version 4.2.0) into the NetBSD xsrc source tree. It has
been successfully built and tested on an i386 
<a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>
system. The release notes can be found in
xsrc/xfree/xc/RELNOTES or can be viewed on the web:
<CURRENTSRC>/xsrc/xfree/xc/RELNOTES
<p>
Please submit any problems related to building the X Windows
system from these new sources using send-pr(1) with the
category "xsrc". The XFree86 organisation also has a
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/support.html">support page</a>. 

<DATE>ntp-020114 26 Jan 2002 - Ntpd security enhancement
<p>
Recently, Emmanuel Dreyfus has committed some work on a pseudo-device
named clockctl to <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>. 
This driver offers 
alternative entry points to the time setting related system calls 
settimeofday(2), clock_settime(2), adjtime(2) and ntp_adjtime(2) via a 
device file called /dev/clockctl. The access to these calls are
dependent on the permissions on the /dev/clockctl file; that
is, if a user can write to it, then the user is allowed to
change the system time. As a result, daemons such as ntpd(8)
can be run chrooted and under a non-root UID.
<p>
In order to use this new functionality, make sure you have
an up to date NetBSD-current source tree and add the
following to your kernel config file and rebuild it:
<blockquote>
<tt>pseudo-device       clockctl</tt>
</blockquote>
If you don't have an ntpd user and group on your system, you
need to add this to your passwd and group files. In future
releases of NetBSD, this will be UID 15, GID 15 and with
/var/chroot/ntpd for the home directory.
<p>
To create the clockctl device file, make sure that your
MAKEDEV file is up to date, change to the /dev directory and run:
<blockquote><tt>./MAKEDEV clockctl</tt></blockquote>
<p>
This file is made mode 660 root/ntpd. Once you have done
this you can run ntpd as a non-root user:
<blockquote><tt>ntpd -u ntpd:ntpd</tt></blockquote>
There is also a -t chrootdir option.
<p>
There are more details in <a
href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2002/01/14/0001.html">
Emmanuel's announcement</a>.

<DATE>mips20010105 05 Jan 2002 - MIPS-based NetBSD ports switched to the new toolchain
    Jason Thorpe has recently switched the NetBSD MIPS-based ports to use
    the new GCC 2.95.3/Binutils 2.11.2-based toolchain. Rafal Boni has put
    a great deal of effort into making the toolchain work on the MIPS ports. 
    The change has been tested on an
    Algorithmics P-5064 and also on some SGI machines.
    <p>
    If you use these ports and you are about to update to a recent version 
    of <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>, it is vital 
    that you install the new ld.elf_so first to cope with an ABI change 
    in the new toolchain. The build.sh
    script supplied with the NetBSD-current sources can be used to build the
    system. If you use a MIPS-based port and you encounter problems with the 
    change, please send a bug report with send-pr(1).


<DATE>acorn32wscons 04 Jan 2002 - NetBSD/acorn32 X server support for wscons
    Ben Harris has made modifications to Xarm32VIDC (the X server used by
    <a href="../Ports/acorn32">NetBSD/acorn32</a>) so that it works 
    with wscons(4). This means that it works on the Acorn NC. 

    There is a binary snapshot of the modified <a 
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/acorn32/misc/Xarm32VIDC-wscons.gz">Xarm32VIDC 
    server</a> which should be compatible with NetBSD 1.5 or above. 
    The support is also available in source form 
	(<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/xsrc/xc.tar.gz">xc.tar.gz</a>). 
    <p>
    It should be noted that this work is in its early stages. In particular,  
    keyboard support needs to be improved and there is no proper screen
    blanking or DPMS support. However the software is usable.
    <p>
    Eventually Ben hopes to add VIDC/wscons support into the modular XFree86
    4 server.

<DATE>newdev200101 04 Jan 2002 - New developer
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome a new developer:  
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Mark Davies <markd@NetBSD.org>, who will be working on the NetBSD  
    packages collection. Mark has recently been doing some good work  
    on the KDE packages in pkgsrc.  
    </ul>

<DATE>report2001 04 Jan 2002 - NetBSD in 2001 - A Report

<DATE>011219-acorn-nc 19 Dec 2001 - Improvements in Acorn NC support
    Ben Harris has modified the "<tt>ne at podulebus</tt>" driver to work
    around a bug in the MX98905 chip used on EtherI and EtherN cards, so they
    can now be used on NetBSD.  He has also tweaked the <tt>vidcvideo</tt>
    driver to find screen modes correctly on the ARM7500.  Between them, these
    allow an <tt>NC_WSCONS</tt> kernel to come up multi-user, with a proper
    display.
    <p>
    Ben is now working on getting X up and running on his Acorn NC.
    <p>

    href="../Ports/acorn32/">NetBSD/acorn32 port page</a>.

<DATE>011219-amiga 19 Dec 2001 - NetBSD/amiga now has two-stage booter
    Michael L. Hitch has updated NetBSD/amiga <a
    href="../Releases/current.html">-current</a> to have a two-stage booter.
    <p>
    The first stage is <tt>bootxx_ffs</tt> (for ffs boot partitions) or
    <tt>bootxx_fd</tt> (for bootable floppy disk).  These locate, load,
    and execute the second stage loader <tt>boot.amiga</tt>.  The console
    screen is created and passed to the second stage loader.
    <p>
    The second stage loader uses loadfile() to load the kernel image,
    which can be either <tt>a.out</tt> or <tt>ELF</tt> format, and can
    also be compressed (via gzip(1)).  It will load a kernel file from
    <tt>ffs</tt> file systems or the <tt>ustarfs</tt> used on floppy disks.
    <p>
    More information on NetBSD/amiga is available at the <a
    href="../Ports/amiga/">NetBSD/amiga port page</a>.

<DATE>011218-softdep 18 Dec 2001 - Recent softdep changes
    Frank van der Linden has pulled over some recent fixes from <a
    href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> by <a
    href="http://www.mckusick.com/">Kirk McKusick</a> to the
    softdep code. One of them is to correctly track the numbers
    of free blocks/inodes, taking the pending softdeps into account.
    For this, two new fields (previously spare ones) were added.
    <p>
    This means that if you're using the <tt>FFS_EI</tt> option, you should
    recompile and install fsck_ffs(8) before booting a new kernel,
    in order to have these fields correctly swapped in the case
    of fsck repairing the superblock.
    <p>
    If the kernel mutters a little when it mounts filesystems for
    the first time with a new kernel, don't worry about it.  If it
    continues to do that, please <a
    href="../Misc/send-pr.html">file a problem report</a>.
    <p>
    Also, in an unrelated change to the fixes mentioned above, the
    '<tt>softdep_write_complete: lock is held</tt>' panics (for
    people who used <tt>DEBUG</tt> kernels) should be history now.

<DATE>011217-m68k 17 Dec 2001 - ELF m68k-based ports switched to new-toolchain
    Steve Woodford has just switched all ELF m68k-based ports over to
    new-toolchain.
    <p>
    When you next update your NetBSD source tree and attempt to rebuild
    the world, you should read /usr/src/<CURRENTSRC>BUILDING, then use the
    <tt>build.sh</tt> shell script instead of "make build".
    <p>
    As usual, if you find any problems, please report them via the lists
    and/or send-pr(1).

<DATE>011217-newdev 17 Dec 2001 - New developers
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome six new developers:

<DATE>pppoe-011216 16 Dec 2001 - Integrated PPPoE support in NetBSD-current complete
    Martin Husemann has completed in-kernel support for PPP over Ethernet
    in <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.  Changes
    include rc.d support, ip-up/ip-down scripts, and new documentation.
    The pppoe<b></b>(8) man page has more details.
    <p>
    Due to several requests, it is planned to backport in-kernel PPPoE support
    to the <tt>netbsd-1-5</tt> branch.  This means that it should also be
    available in the NetBSD 1.5.3 release.
    <p>
    This support has been tested thoroughly by many people and on multiple
    architectures.  No problems are expected, but if you do run into one

    kernel build machinery.
    <p>
    Kernel makefiles are now mostly assignments to make variables that get
    digested by <tt>sys/conf/Makefile.kern.inc</tt>, which provides the glue
    that makes it into a kernel.  Redundancy is
    now gone from kernel makefiles, meaning that development drift of one
    kernel makefile (instead of over all) is no longer that much of a
    problem.  Additionally, new "features" for kernels and kernel
    builds can now be added, modified, or removed much more easily.
    <p>
    Everyone should make sure their config(8) is up to date (you should do
    this anyway).  It is also a good idea to rerun <tt>config</tt> for any
    <a href="../Releases/current.html">-current</a> kernels you've been
    building lately.
    <p>
    Extensive testing was done before these changes, so no problems are
    anticipated.  If you <i>do</i> have any problems, please report them
    with send-pr(1).

<DATE>sysctl-uvm 08 Dec 2001 - New sysctl tunables for UVM page-replacement 
    Chuck Silvers has committed changes to create three new sysctl tunables
    that enforce a maximum amount of memory used for the different types
    of page allocations (anonymous process memory, cached file data,
    and cached executable data).  He has also renamed some of the old sysctl
    tunables to have less obscure names.
    <p>
    The old tunables are now named:
    <p>
<pre><tt>      vm.anonmin
      vm.filemin      (instead of vm.vnodemin)
      vm.execmin      (instead of vm.vtextmin)</tt></pre>
    <p>
    The new tunables are: 
    <p>
<pre><tt>      vm.anonmax
      vm.filemax
      vm.execmax</tt></pre>
    <p>
    The values for the new tunables are percentages of RAM, just like the
    old ones.  The "max" limits in this context are only enforced when there
    isn't enough memory to satisfy all requests, so the usage for a given
    type can exceed the maximum if there is no demand for the other types.
    <p>
    More information can be found in Chuck's announcement in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/tech-kern/2001/12/08/0006.html">tech-kern
    mail archive</a>.

<DATE>irda 05 Dec 2001 - Initial IrDA support
        Lennart Augustsson has added initial support for IrDA
        communication to the kernel.  It presents IrDA frames to
        userland; the kernel has all the knowledge of how to talk to
        the actual hardware and presents a uniform interface to the
        userland protocol stack.
        <p>
        More information can be found in <a
        href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2001/12/05/0008.html">Lennart's
        post to the current-users mailing list</a>.

<DATE>pkgsysconfdir 03 Dec 2001 - Customizable Location of NetBSD Package Configuration files
	Johnny Lam has committed some changes to NetBSD 
	<a href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">pkgsrc</a> 
	to implement a variable <tt>PKG_SYSCONFDIR</tt> used to specify
	the location of configuration files for NetBSD packages. 
	<p>
	The idea of this change is to cater for various tastes of the user
	community. For example, some people like to keep all of their
	configuration files in /etc. Some feel that all package files
	should reside in /usr/pkg, whilst others wish to share /usr/pkg between
	several machines. 
	<p>
	The variable can be set in /etc/mk.conf so that future packages use the
	facility. Furthermore, the configuration file directory can be set on a 
	per-package basis. For example, setting
	<blockquote>
	<tt>PKG_SYSCONFDIR.apache=/etc/apache</tt>
	</blockquote>
	in /etc/mk.conf will 
	result in the Apache package using the directory /etc/apache to 
	hold its configuration files. 
	<p>
	Naturally for this change to work across pkgsrc, relevant packages 
	need to be converted to use the new variable. This process has been 
	started.

<DATE>atapist 03 Dec 2001 - ATAPI tape drive support
    Manuel Bouyer has committed some final touches to NetBSD's ATAPI tape
    drive driver in <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.
    The driver has been tested with an
    OnStream ATAPI drive and has been reported to work with Seagate
    ATAPI drives. If you have a different ATAPI tape drive and the
    driver works with it, please report it to <current-users@NetBSD.org>.

<DATE>curses-011202 02 Dec 2001 - Updated curses in tree
    Brett Lymn has committed changes to curses in <a
    href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a> to implement the
    newterm and set_term functions.  The changes are quite extensive at a
    fundamental level.
    <p>
    One thing to look out for is that you must update your <tt>vi</tt>
    source and recompile that after installing the new libcurses
    otherwise <tt>vi</tt> will fail.  This is NOT a bug with curses; this
    is a problem with <tt>vi</tt> stealing library function names in certain
    configurations.  In this case <tt>vi</tt> defines its own newterm if
    it has been told there is not one in libcurses.  I have committed the
    config file change for this to the <tt>vi</tt> sources so you should
    be ok.
    <p>
    If anyone has any problems with curses after this change please report
    them with send-pr(1).

<DATE>usbv2 26 Nov 2001 - USB v2.0 support added to NetBSD-current
    Lennart Augustsson has added support for USB v2.0 devices into <a
    href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>. The new <i>ehci</i> 
    driver is still in
    development but is in a working state for some mass storage
    devices, such as CD-RW drives. USB v2.0 offers a vast speed
    improvement (480Mb/s instead of 12Mb/s) over the original USB
    specification, and retains a good level of compatibility.

<DATE>mca 18 Nov 2001 - NetBSD/i386 on IBM PS/2 (MCA) machines
    Jaromir Dolecek <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/netbsd-announce/2001/11/17/0000.html">announced</a>
    the IBM PS/2 (MCA) machine
    support in <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a> has
    reached the point where it's usable for general work and should
    provide stable multiuser service.  The system installation tool
    (sysinst) was also changed to support installation on this class of
    i386 machines.  See the INSTALL documents for exact details, like
    which boot floppies to use for installation, etc.
    Until the next major release (NetBSD 1.6), PS/2 support will only
    be available via NetBSD/i386 -current <a
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/snapshot/">binary
    snapshots</a>.
    <p>
    The development on this support will, of course, continue, with more
    device drivers to be written as well as expanded documentation.

<DATE>pkgsrc-speedups 08 Nov 2001 - Speed-ups committed to pkgsrc
    Alistair G. Crooks has committed changes to bsd.pkg.mk to improve
    the speed of source builds.
    <p>
    The first stage was committed last week, when the scripts directory
    was removed along with the logic to look in the scripts directory for a
    script named pre-&lt;target&gt; or post-&lt;target&gt;, or configure,
    and was replaced by explicit calling of the scripts from a package
    Makefile's corresponding target.  Please note this if you have
    locally-produced or maintained packages.
    <p>
    The next step was to remove the .USE macro, and replace it with
    explicit make(1) targets, and specify the dependencies on those
    targets in a normal Makefile way.
    <p>
    More details are available in Alistair's message in the <a

<DATE>audit-011013 12 Oct 2001 - Major overhaul of NetBSD's security audit system
    Luke Mewburn and Andrew Brown have finished some major changes to
    NetBSD's built-in security auditing system. The system watches a
    configurable number of files, and reports changes to them. Reports can
    include the changes made for text-based configuration files or general
    notifications of changed files e.g. for binary files. Subsystems audited
    include the system's network configuration, user authentication
    information, disk configuration and many others. Of course, users can
    always add more data to monitor if the need arises. See the <a

<DATE>pcmcia-audio-010930 30 Sep 2001 - PCMCIA audio driver added
    Jared D. McNeill has contributed a driver for the Eiger Labs PCMCIA sound
    card. The driver uses programmed IO to access the sound card, as the PCMCIA
    bus does not allow doing direct memory access (DMA) from the card. Still it 
    the driver is capable of 8- and 16-bit audio sample playback at rates up 
    to 44.1kHz. This is the first PCMCIA audio driver available for NetBSD!

<DATE>nd-010929 29 Sep 2001 - New developers
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome six new developers:   
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Stoned Elipot, <seb@NetBSD.org>, who has been helping with
	the <a href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
	Collection (pkgsrc)</a> by submitting many pkgsrc PRs in the past.
	He will continue helping to improve pkgsrc.
	<p>
    <li>Tetsuya Isaki, <isaki@NetBSD.org>, who will be helping with
	<a href="../Ports/x68k/">NetBSD/x68k</a>.  He is already
	working on some device drivers, and will be continuing
	with others later.
	<p>
    <li>Martti Kuparinen, <martti@NetBSD.org>, who has been
	contributing many PRs for the <a
	href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
	Collection (pkgsrc)</a>.  He will now be able to continue
	improving pkgsrc with direct commits.
	<p>
    <li>Chris Pinnock, <cjep@NetBSD.org>, who will be helping with
	htdocs, pkgsrc, and bulk-builds of binary packages.  Additionally,
	Chris also runs NetBSD www and ISO mirrors located in the UK, and
	has been helping out with NetBSD www-team tasks for a while now.
	<p>
    <li>Tracy Di Marco White, <gendalia@NetBSD.org>, who will be
	helping with internal project maintenance tasks.
	<p>
    <li>Someya Yoshihiko, <someya@NetBSD.org>, who will be working
	on miscellaneous device drivers, including drivers for
	PCI sound hardware.
    </ul>

<DATE>pkgsrc-sig 25 Sep 2001 - Digital signatures for binary packages
    Alistair Crooks has committed changes to pkg_add(1); adding the
    ability to verify the contents of a binary package by using
    digital signatures.  This has been accomplished by added a
    "<tt>-s <i>verification-type</i></tt>" command line
    argument to pkg_add(1).
    <p>
    The following verification types have been defined:
    <tt>gpg</tt> (pkgsrc/security/<PKGSRC>security/gnupg),
    <tt>pgp5</tt> (pkgsrc/security/<PKGSRC>security/pgp5),
    and <tt>none</tt>.  Callouts are made to the relevant
    programs to verify the contents of the binary package, and
    its provenance. You are then asked whether you want to
    proceed with the installation. The "<tt>none</tt>" verification
    type is the same as the existing behaviour, and is also the
    default - in which case, no verification of the binary package
    is done.
    <p>
    The verification type is passed onto recursive pkg_add(1)
    invocations for dependent packages
    <p>
    At the moment, the ability to verify packages is limited to
    those which are not specified by URL; removing this restriction
    is being looked at.
    <p>
    More details are located in Alistair's announcement in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/tech-pkg/2001/09/25/0005.html">tech-pkg
    mail archive</a>.

<DATE>atari_elf 22 Sep 2001 - NetBSD/atari switches to ELF
    Thomas Gerner has committed changes to convert the <a
    href="../Ports/atari/">NetBSD/atari</a> port to ELF.  With the
    COMPAT_AOUT_M68K kernel option, all your old a.out binaries should
    still work.  Note that a.out versions of ifconfig(8) and
    route(8) will <em>not</em> work due to some structure
    alignment problems.
    <p>
    A NetBSD/atari ELF snapshot is available at:

<DATE>uvm-010915 15 Sep 2001 - Recent UVM changes
    Chuck Silvers has committed a large amount of UVM changes he has been
    working on for the past few months, including the <tt>vfs_reinit</tt> and
    <tt>softdep-poolification</tt> changes that have been discussed recently
    on the NetBSD <a href="../MailingLists/">mailing lists</a>.
    <p>
    Most of the changes are related to improving performance and robustness
    under load.  As an example, on a PC, Chuck saw the elapsed time for

<DATE>bsd-api 22 Aug 2001 - BSD API mailing lists
    At the last <a href="../gallery/events.html#usenix-2001">Usenix BSD
    MegaBOF</a>, the concept of mailing lists to be used for announcing
    changes to the BSD APIs was proposed.  The notion was to have a
    place where people can post messages about new APIs they were adding
    to their flavour of BSD, so that people from other BSDs would be
    aware of the activity.
    <p>
    Since then, two mailing lists have been created.  One is for
    announcements, and the other is for calmy discussing such APIs
    and their design.
    <p>
    These two lists are:
    <p>
    <blockquote><tt>
    bsd-api-announce@wasabisystems.com<br>
    bsd-api-discuss@wasabisystems.com
    </tt></blockquote>
    <p>
    Both lists can be subscribed to via majordomo, and they're both
    moderated.  More information about the charter of these lists
    is available via majordomo by sending a mail with
    "<tt>info <i>list-name</i></tt>" in the body.

    This version fixes a security problem, reported by <a
    href="http://www.securityfocus.com/">SecurityFocus</a>,
    regarding command line processing.  This vulnerability, present in
    all 8.11 and 8.12.0.Beta versions up to 8.11.6 and 8.12.0Beta19, is not
    remotely exploitable.
    <p>
    In pkgsrc, the mail/<PKGSRC>mail/sendmail package has also been updated
    to 8.11.6.
    <p>
    Also of interest are the <a

    it works for you.  If you have problems with it, please file a bug report
    with send-pr(1).
    <p>
    This support is based off Jason Wright's bridge driver for OpenBSD,
    with changes by Jason Thorpe.

<DATE>ffs_ei 17 Aug 2001 - FFS_EI code changes
    Luke Mewburn has committed changes so that mounting opposite-endian
    file systems using the FFS_EI kernel option should be significantly
    more stable.  He has also updated various tools to reflect these
    changes (fsck_ffs(8), dump(8), dumpfs(8), etc).
    <p>
    Support for reading and writing FFS in non-native byte order, conditioned
    to "<tt>options FFS_EI</tt>", was added to NetBSD by Manuel Bouyer.
    Coupled with Luke's recent changes, one should now be able to <tt>fsck</tt>,
    <tt>dump</tt>, <tt>dumpfs</tt> (etc) opposite endian file systems, mount
    and use them, and convert them with
    '<tt>fsck_ffs -B newendian ....</tt>'.

<DATE>mvme177 09 Aug 2001 - Recent improvements to NetBSD/mvme68k
    The port of NetBSD to Motorola's 68k VME board computers,
    <a href="../Ports/mvme68k/">NetBSD/mvme68k</a>, has had some
    improvements as of late.
    <p>
    Thanks to a donation of a <a
    href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=955&amp;ProductID=5&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME177</a>
    to the NetBSD Foundation by Matt Thomas, Steve Woodford has been able
    to complete the support for this m68060-based board in NetBSD/mvme68k
    -current.
    <p>
    Accordingly, Steve has made available a new NetBSD/mvme68k snapshot,
    based on 2001-08-07 -current sources.  It is available in the NetBSD/mvme68k
    <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/mvme68k/snapshot/">snapshot
    area of the ftp server</a>.
    <p>
    Since the last -current snapshot, a number of notable changes have made
    it into the NetBSD/mvme68k kernel:
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>The MI evcnt(9) interface is now used to record interrupt statistics.
        <p>
      <li>The standalone netboot program now supports DHCP in addition to
        rarp/bootparams.
        <p>
      <li>`Simulated' software interrupts have been replaced by real `hardware
        assisted' software interrupts. This reduces the amount of overhead
        on exit from exception handlers.
        <p>
      <li>Numerous pmap tweaks to improve reliability.
        <p>
      <li>The ECC DRAM controller(s) on MVME167/MVME177 (and optional on
        MVME162/MVME172) are now fully enabled. The kernel will now detect
        and log any errors reported by the controllers. You may need to change
        your kernel config files, as the memc(4) driver now attaches at mainbus0
        instead of pcctwo0. Note that the memc(4) driver does not yet support
        the MEMC040 parity checking memory controllers found on some boards.
        <p>
      <li>And, of course, completed MVME177 support.
    </ol>
    <p>
    As usual, if you experience any problems, please report them using
    send-pr(1) and/or the <a

<DATE>xf4-snap-i386 12 Jul 2001 - XFree86 4.0.3/4.1.0 snapshots for NetBSD/i386 1.5.1
    Havard Eidnes has put together an unofficial snapshot of XFree86
    version 4.0.3 built on NetBSD/i386 1.5.1.  This is built from the
    <tt>xsrc</tt> tree just before the 4.1 version was imported.  The
    build tree was subsequently modified to include <a
    href="ftp://ftp.matrox.com/pub/mga/archive/linux/2001/beta_1_3_0/">Matrox's
    drivers</a>.  This means that the Matrox G450 cards are supported,
    instead of being probed and "refused", as would be the case with
    plain 4.0.3.
    <p>
    Also, Hubert Feyrer has put together an unofficial snapshot of
    XFree86 version 4.1.0 built on NetBSD/i386 1.5.1.  This snapshot
    is based on the 4.1.0 sources in the <tt>xsrc</tt> tree as of 2001-07-09.

<DATE>x86_64 22 Jun 2001 - NetBSD/x86_64: a port for AMD's upcoming line of 64-bit CPUs
    Last week, a port of NetBSD to the x86-64 (tm) architecture was
    committed to the NetBSD CVS repository.  The x86-64 is AMD's
    upcoming 64-bit line of CPUs.  For now, it is only known to work
    on the Virtutech simulator, since no x86-64 hardware is available
    yet.  In this environment, it runs multi-user.
    <p>
    NetBSD/x86_64 is the 44th architecture that NetBSD runs on.
    <p>
    The porting was done by Frank van der Linden of Wasabi Systems,
    with kind support from AMD, who provided the simulator and fast
    machines to run it on.
    <p>
    The Wasabi press release about this can be found at:
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.wasabisystems.com/news/pr20010622.html">http://www.wasabisystems.com/news/pr20010622.html</a>
    <p>

<DATE>new-pipes 18 Jun 2001 - High performance pipe implementation in NetBSD-current
    Jarom&iacute;r Dolecek has committed a port of the high performance
    pipe implementation, written by John S. Dyson for the <a
    href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD Project</a>, to <a
    href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.  It's optional
    at the moment, and you'll need to add '<tt>options NEW_PIPE</tt>' to
    your kernel configuration file if you wish to use it.
    <p>
    The speed enhancement between the old socketbased-pair implementation
    and this one ranges from 20% to 300%, with machines having a slow CPU
    receiving the most notable boost.  Since the new pipe implementation
    was changed to take advantage of UVM uvm_loan() facilities to avoid
    one memory to memory copy, all machines should see a performance
    improvement.
    <p>
    After further testing, this new implementation is planned to become
    the default.

<DATE>cesfic 14 Jun 2001 - NetBSD/cesfic: a port to the FIC8234 VME processor board
    Matthias Drochner has ported NetBSD to the FIC8234 VME processor
    board, made by the Swiss company CES (Geneve).  These boards are
    (or have been) popular in high energy physics data acquisition.
    <p>
    The port is far along enough for multiuser and self-hosting at this
    point - but SCSI support, among other things, haven't been added yet.
    <p>
    Matthias Drochner is the NetBSD/cesfic port maintainer. 
    <p>
    More information is available at the <a
    href="../Ports/cesfic/">NetBSD/cesfic</a> port page.

<DATE>walnut 14 Jun 2001 - NetBSD/walnut: a port to IBM's 405GP Reference Board
    Eduardo Horvath and Simon Burge have ported NetBSD to IBM's 405GP
    Reference Board, also known as the "Walnut".
    <p>
    The Walnut is an ATX form-factor motherboard designed to drop into a
    PC case.  It has the usual PCI bus, peripherals, and such.  More
    information on the Walnut can be found on IBM's web site:

<DATE>pmap-mpc6xx 06 Jun 2001 - New pmap module for Motorola MPC6xx CPUs in -current
    Matt Thomas has committed a new pmap module for the PowerPC 60x, 7xx (G3),
    74xx (G4) CPUs to <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.
    The new pmap is simpler and faster than the previous pmap module it

    GENERIC <a href="../Ports/macppc/">NetBSD/macppc</a> kernel build dropped
    by 40%.
    <p>
    Also in Matt's commits were organization changes.  In the near future,
    support for PowerPCs with different MMUs will be added to NetBSD.  In
    preparation for this, the new pmap and its files were placed in two new
    directories: sys/arch/powerpc/mpc6xx and sys/arch/powerpc/include/mpc6xx.
    The MPC6xx dependent header files in powerpc/include (bat.h, hid.h,
    hid_601.h, pte.h) have been moved to powerpc/include/mpc6xx along with
    the mpc6xx specific pmap.h.
    <p>
    A new kernel configuration option has been defined (PPC_MPC6XX) and has
    been added to std.&lt;port&gt; for the <a href="../Ports/bebox/">bebox</a>
    and <a href="../Ports/macppc/">macppc</a> ports.  The <a
    href="../Ports/prep/">prep</a> port will be updated soon.

<DATE>iha-driver 03 Jun 2001 - Driver for Initio INIC-940/950 PCI SCSI controllers
    Izumi Tsutsui has added a driver for the Initio INIC-940/950 SCSI
    controllers to <a
    href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.  This driver
    is based on OpenBSD's iha driver, with some modified structures.

<DATE>nd-010603 03 Jun 2001 - New developer 
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome a new developer:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Mario Kemper, <magick@NetBSD.org>, who will be working with the <a
	href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
	Collection (pkgsrc)</a> and X11 sources.
    </ul>

<DATE>hw-csum 03 Jun 2001 - Hardware IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming support
    Jason Thorpe has committed his changes to support in-bound and
    out-bound IPv4, TCP, and UDP checksumming to <a
    href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.  It is
    currently supported on the NatSemi DP83820 Gigabit Ethernet
    (<em>gsip</em>), 3Com Etherlink XL (<em>ex</em>), and Alteon
    Tigon/Tigon2 Gigabit Ethernet (<em>ti</em>).  There is also
    support for caching the IPv6 pseudo-header checksum, which
    should save some CPU time for IPv6 users, as well.
    <p>
    If you have any problems with these changes, please report them
    with send-pr(1).

<DATE>vax-smp 31 May 2001 - NetBSD/vax now runs multicpu
    Anders Magnusson got his VAX 8350 to use all three processors.
    From the testing done so far, the system works quite fine.  Most
    of the code is in the source tree already, the rest will undergo
    a bit more cleanup and polishing, and will then be committed to
    the development branch, NetBSD-current.
    <p>

    The VAX 8350 system is probably the slowest multiprocessor system
    that NetBSD will ever support; each CPU does about 2VUPS (~2MIPS).
    Note that the 8350 normally only has two CPUs, the third one was
    plugged in for testing purpose.
    <p>

    It shouldn't be too hard to make NetBSD/vax running on some funnier
    machines, like the 8800, which has two 6VUPS KA88 CPUs, and the
    6000 series, which can take up to six CPUs with upto 32VUPS
    altogether.  Stay tuned!
    <p>

    For curious parties, there's a dmesg(8) and top(1) output below.
    Also, for all the youth
    out there spoiled by workstations and PCs, here are a few pictures
    showing what a <em>real</em> computer looks like:
    <p>

    Here's a <a href="http://www.ludd.luth.se/gallery/ludd1-mII/ftp.luth.se_mark_IV-4.jpg">VAX 8800</a> (the four rightmost sections with brown top),

<DATE>algor 29 May 2001 - NetBSD ported to Algorithmics MIPS evaluation boards
    <b>Update 06/01:</b> Jason Thorpe, the NetBSD/algor port maintainer,
    has added support for the Algorithmics P-4032 board.  This new
    support is untested as Jason doesn't have a P-4032 yet.
    <p>
    Jason Thorpe has ported NetBSD to the <a
    href="http://www.algor.co.uk/">Algorithmics</a> MIPS evaluation boards.
    The new port is called NetBSD/algor, and it currently supports the
    P-5064, which has a QED RM5xxx CPU soldered on.
    <p>
    There is some skeletal support for the P-4032 (an older board, which has
    an R4xxx CPU).  There are some placeholders for the P-6032, which is
    their newest board, but no real code yet (the P-6032 has a different PCI
    controller, the Algorithmics BONITO).
    <p>
    There are still some issues with the NetBSD/algor kernel (apparently
    softintr-related), but it works well-enough to self-host.
    <p>
    Thank you to <a href="http://www.allegronetworks.com/">Allegro Networks</a>
    for loaning Jason a P-5064 board on which to do the port.

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed checkportcmd for the IPv4 case.
      <li>Added support for S/Key authentication.
      <li>Use method other than glob(3) to do ~ expansion.
      <li>Improve portability.
      <li>Rewrite method of handling out-of-band operations, in order
	to more easily support RFC2228 security extensions in a future

<DATE>next68k_elf 12 May 2001 - NetBSD/next68k switches to ELF
    Chuck Silvers has committed changes to convert the <a
    href="../Ports/next68k/">NetBSD/next68k</a> port to ELF.  With the
    COMPAT_AOUT_M68K kernel option, all your old a.out binaries should
    still work.  Note that a.out versions of ifconfig(8) and
    route(8) will <em>not</em> work due to some structure
    alignment problems.
    <p> 
    No full NetBSD/next68k ELF snapshot has been made available yet, but
    you can grab the NetBSD/sun3 ELF snapshot at:

<DATE>1.5.1releasecycle-2 09 May 2001 - New information on the NetBSD 1.5.1 release cycle
    <b>Update:</b> 1.5.1_BETA2 snapshots are available for <a

    href="../Ports/vax/">NetBSD/vax</a>, and <a
    href="../Ports/x68k/">NetBSD/x68k</a>.
    <p>
    On April 6th, the release cycle for NetBSD 1.5.1 started.  NetBSD 1.5.1
    will be a <a href="../Releases/release-map.html">patch release</a>,
    improving stability and fixing bugs in <a
    href="../Releases/formal-1.5/">NetBSD 1.5</a>.
    <p>
    The release cycle started with a thorough testing period of the
    <tt>netbsd-1-5</tt> branch.  This was NetBSD 1.5.1_BETA; and so far
    it looks to have been successful.  During this period, the 1.5.1
    source tree did see some activity - as documentation was updated,
    a couple of bugs were fixed, and some drivers from the trunk (<a
    href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>) were pulled up
    to the <tt>netbsd-1-5</tt> branch.  A <a
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-5/src/CHANGES-1.5.1">complete
    list</a> of changes to the <tt>netbsd-1-5</tt> branch from the release
    of NetBSD 1.5 through the end of NetBSD 1.5.1_BETA is available.
    <p>
    What will happen now are 1.5.1_BETA2 snapshots.  This is to ensure
    that the fixes and additions during NetBSD 1.5.1_BETA sit well (there's
    no reason to believe otherwise, but better safe than sorry).  The
    1.5.1_BETA2 snapshots will be appearing shortly (both the relevant
    port pages and this news entry will be updated when they're available).
    If you can, please test these.
    <p>
    The 1.5.1_BETA2 source tree is the <tt>netbsd-1-5</tt> branch as
    it is now.  If you want to retrieve it - anoncvs, ftp, and sup are
    three ways for you to do so.
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>anoncvs:</b> If you want to retrieve the NetBSD 1.5.1_BETA2 source
	code using anoncvs, update your source tree using the
	"-r netbsd-1-5" flag to the cvs "update" command, or check out a
	separate tree using this flag to the "checkout" command.  If you
	want to update your 1.5.1_BETA2 source tree, you should always use
	the "-r netbsd-1-5" flag to make sure you aren't retrieving
	NetBSD-current mistakenly.
	<p>
      <li><b>ftp:</b> On the FTP server, the 1.5.1_BETA2 source tree is
	available in the <a
	href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-5/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-5/</a>
	directory.  The extracted sources are updated daily, and the tar
	files are updated weekly.
	<p>
      <li><b>sup:</b> For people who want to retrieve the 1.5.1_BETA2 source
	tree via SUP, you'll want the "release-1-5" collection.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The planned release date of NetBSD 1.5.1 is after 1.5.1_BETA2.  This
    most likely means early June.
    <p>

<DATE>sun2 09 May 2001 - NetBSD ported to the Sun 2
    In January 2001, Matthew Fredette began porting NetBSD to the <a
    href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a> Sun 2 series of
    computers.  These machines are based on the Motorola 68010 CPU with
    a Sun-designed custom MMU, and were sold as both servers
    and desktop workstations from the early to mid 1980's.  They were
    superceded by the Sun 3 systems, which are supported by NetBSD under
    the <a href="../Ports/sun3/">NetBSD/sun3</a> port.
    <p>
    After some work, Matt had his new port booting multiuser; and in
    April 2001 he began merging it into the NetBSD tree.
    <p>
    More information about the current status of NetBSD/sun2 is available
    at the <a href="../Ports/sun2/">NetBSD/sun2 port page</a>.

<DATE>bouyer-via 04 May 2001 - Improved support for VIA chipsets in NetBSD-current
    Manuel Bouyer has committed some improvements to the VIA code in
    pciide(4).  On capable controllers, it should now run reliably at
    Ultra/66.  Also, preliminary support for the 686b has been added.

<DATE>agc0105 02 May 2001 - Changes to the NetBSD Packages Collection in April 2001
    Alistair G. Crooks has sent out his monthly summary of changes to the 
    NetBSD Packages Collection.  The write up for changes in April 2001 is
    available in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2001/05/02/0010.html">current-users
    mail archive</a>.
    <p>
    There is also an automated list of pkgsrc changes, generated daily from
    <CURRENTSRC>pkgsrc/doc/CHANGES, available on the <a
    href="pkg-changes.html">Recent packages changes</a> page.

<DATE>vax4000-705a 01 May 2001 - Support for the VAX 4000/705A in NetBSD/vax
    <a href="mailto:michael@unixiron.org">Michael Kukat</a> has written
    support for the VAX 4000/705A in NetBSD/vax.  This new support has
    been committed, and is available in NetBSD/vax -current.
    <p>
    More information about NetBSD/vax is available at the <a
    href="../Ports/vax/">NetBSD/vax port page</a>.

<DATE>sushi-additions 26 Apr 2001 - New menu structures for sushi
    Tim Rightnour has committed new <tt>networking configuration</tt> and
    <tt>processes</tt> menu structures to sushi.  In addition, a new
    <tt>sysctl</tt> form has been added to the existing <tt>system
    menu</tt> structure.
    <p>
    Sushi is an interactive, menu-based program that is
    designed to aid the user or administrator with administrative
    and complex tasks on their machines.
    Sushi provides a menu of various functions that the user can perform on
    his or her machine.  Once the user selects a desired function, the
    function is either performed outright, or in most cases, the user is
    asked to fill in a simple form with required and optional information,
    which is then processed by sushi, and the action occurs.
    <p>
    The new networking configuration menu structure allows sushi to do
    tasks like edit /etc/exports, modify NIC configuration, and setup
    YP/NIS.  The processes menu structure will allow starting /
    stopping / showing / restarting of things in /etc/rc.d.  The new
    sysctl form in the system menu structure allows a user to both set
    sysctl's interactively, and save them in /etc/sysctl.conf.
    <p>
    People running a NetBSD system with sushi already installed can
    update their menu structures easily by running '<tt>make install</tt>'
    in '<tt>sharesrc/share/sushi</tt>'.  Of course if you do a '<tt>make
    build</tt>' or install a snapshot based on <a
    href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a> sources
    past 2001-04-26, you'll get the updated menus also.

<DATE>thorpej_scsipi 25 Apr 2001 - Merge of thorpej_scsipi branch in NetBSD-current
    Manuel Bouyer has merged the <tt>thorpej_scsipi</tt> branch in <a
    href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.  The
    <tt>thorpej_scsipi</tt> branch was created for a complete rewrite of
    the SCSI/ATAPI mid-layer.  After the merge today, that rewrite
    is now in NetBSD-current.   The following is an overview of the
    changes and features:
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>All xfers are queued in the mid-layer, rather than doing so in
	an ad-hoc fashion in individual adapter drivers.
      <li>Adapter/channel resource management in the mid-layer, avoids
	even trying to start running an xfer if the adapter/channel doesn't
	have the resources.
      <li>Better communication between the mid-layer and the adapters.
      <li>Asynchronous event notification mechanism from adapter to
	mid-layer and peripherals.
      <li>Better peripheral queue management: freeze/thaw, sorted requeueing
	during recovery, etc.
      <li>Clean separation of peripherals, adapters, and adapter channels
	(no more scsipi_link). 
      <li>Kernel thread for each scsipi_channel makes error recovery much
	easier (no more dealing with interrupt context when recovering from
	an error).
      <li>Mid-layer support for tagged queueing: commands can have the tag
	type set explicitly, tag IDs are allocated in the mid-layer (thus
	eliminating the need to use buggy tag ID allocation schemes in many
	adapter drivers).  
      <li>Support for QUEUE FULL and CHECK CONDITION status in mid-layer;
	the command will be requeued, or a REQUEST SENSE will be sent as
	appropriate.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The core scsipi is well tested, but a number of HBA drivers need
    testing. If you encounter any problems please report them with
    send-pr(1) and they'll get handled as soon as possible.

<DATE>fsmlabs-rtlbsd 21 Apr 2001 - FSMLabs announces RTLinux support for NetBSD
    <a href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/">FSMLabs</a> announced that its
    RTLinux operating system is now available with a NetBSD component.
    The new RTLinux on BSD (RTL/BSD) uses NetBSD as its general purpose OS.
    <p>
    RTLinux is a 'high speed, efficient and small realtime kernel' based
    on the POSIX 10003.13 PS51 specification.  Using a patented
    dual-kernel design, RTLinux runs a general purpose OS as the lowest
    priority thread of the realtime kernel.
    <p>
    FSMLabs Principal Engineer Michael Barabanov stated that "RTLinux
    applications can transparently make use of either Linux or
    BSD. We are very happy to be able to be able to give customers this
    additional choice."
    <p>
    RTL/BSD is available from <a href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/">FSMLabs</a>
    and is provided with source code, under a binary distribution
    license.
    <p>
    See the <a
    href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/NetBSD_press_release.html#NetBSD">full
    FSMLabs press release</a> for more information.

<DATE>alpha-mp 20 Apr 2001 - NetBSD/alpha MP goes multi-user, code in NetBSD-current
    Jason Thorpe has gotten multiprocessor <a
    href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a> kernels to go multi-user,
    running both user and kernel code on multiple processors.  So far,
    through a kernel build and full userland build, it seems pretty
    stable.
    <p>
    All the code to make this work has been committed to NetBSD-current,
    and testing so far has been on an AlphaServer 1200.  This is the same
    systype as the AlphaServer 4100, so MP configurations of that should
    also work well.
    <p>
    <b>Systems that should work in an MP configuration:</b>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>AlphaServer 1200
      <li>AlphaServer 4100
      <li>DEC/Alpha Processor, Inc. DP264
      <li>DEC/Alpha Processor, Inc. UP2000
      <li>DEC/Alpha Processor, Inc. UP2000+
      <li>API CS20
      <li>Compaq DS20
    </ul>
    <p>
    The AlphaServer 8200/8400 won't work yet.  There are a couple fixes
    which will need to be done before the 8200 and 8400 will work in an
    MP configuration.
    <p>
    More information, including dmesg output from Jason's system, is
    available in his announcement in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/tech-smp/2001/04/20/0000.html">tech-smp

    The port of NetBSD to the ARM-based <a
    href="http://www.netwinder.net/products.phtml">netwinder</a> is stable enough to
    reach multi-user mode.  See the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/tech-ports/2001/04/20/0000.html">post
    to tech-ports</a> by Matt Thomas.

<DATE>vmware-compat 19 Apr 2001 - VMware compatibility package available
    Frank van der Linden has created a VMware compatibility package for
    <a href="../Ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a>.  The package consists of
    a set of kernel modules and scripts that will allow owners of the
    Linux version of VMware to run their binaries under NetBSD.  To use
    this software, a user will need to buy a copy of <a
    href="http://www.vmware.com/support/linux/">VMware for Linux</a>
    and download and install the VMware compatibility package.  This
    can be downloaded at:
    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <a href="http://www.wasabisystems.com/vmware-survey.html">http://www.wasabisystems.com/vmware-survey.html</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    More details are available in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/netbsd-announce/2001/04/19/0000.html">netbsd-announce
    mail archive</a>.
    <p>
    Frank's work on the VMware compatibility package was sponsored by
    <a href="http://www.wasabisystems.com/">Wasabi Systems</a>.
    <p>
    <b>Update:</b> Matthias Scheler has added a
    <PKGSRC>emulators/suse_vmware package to the <a
    href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
    Collection</a>.  The process to set up VMware compatibility in
    NetBSD is now as simple as the following:
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Install the suse_vmware package (e.g. "<tt>cd
	emulators/suse_vmware && make install</tt>" in your pkgsrc
	tree).  After that your <tt>/emul/linux</tt> will be
	set up and ready to go.
      <li>Download and install the <a
	href="http://www.wasabisystems.com/vmware-survey.html">NetBSD
	VMware compatibility package</a> from Wasabi Systems.
	Installation instructions are located in the README.
    </ol>
    <p>
    If you're not running NetBSD-current or NetBSD 1.5.1_BETA, you'll
    need to run a 1.5 branch kernel (based on netbsd-1-5 sources
    after March 31st, 2001) also.  You can either compile that
    yourself, or just grab the kernel from the NetBSD/i386 1.5.1_BETA
    snapshot.

<DATE>lukem-interview 18 Apr 2001 - Interview with NetBSD's Luke Mewburn

<DATE>pkg-files 17 Apr 2001 - Improvements in pkgsrc
    Alistair Crooks has made some more structural changes to the
    pkgsrc system.  All the distfile and distpatch digests have been
    moved from <tt>files/md5</tt> into a new file called <tt>distinfo</tt>.
    Also, if applicable, the digests for any patches have been moved
    from <tt>files/patch-sum</tt> to <tt>distinfo</tt> also.
    <p>
    These changes mean that, due to information being centralized in
    the <tt>distinfo</tt> file, there are a reduced number of files in
    pkgsrc.  You'll see that in the majority of cases there will be
    no files/ subdirectory in packages now.  Also, you should see a
    corresponding speedup in extraction from the pkgsrc.tar.gz file,
    and any cvs updates should also be quicker now.
    <p>
    More information is available in Alistair's announcement in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2001/04/17/0004.html">current-users

<DATE>sandpoint 12 Apr 2001 - NetBSD ported to the Motorola Sandpoint reference platform
    NetBSD/sandpoint is a new port of NetBSD to the <a
    href="http://www.motorola.com/">Motorola</a> <a
    href="http://www.mot.com/SPS/PowerPC/teksupport/refdesigns/sandpoint.html">Sandpoint</a>
    reference platform.
    <p>
    The Sandpoint is a reference platform designed by Motorola to help
    people develop hardware and software around various PowerPC processors.
    The basic system is an ATX form-factor motherboard with standard PC
    devices (IDE, floppy, serial, parallel), 4 PCI slots, and a mezzanine
    slot to which several different processor modules may be attached.
    <p>
    Two processor modules have been tested with this port: The "Unity"
    module with the MPC8240, and the "Altimus" with MPC7400 (G4) and MPC107.
    <p>
    Allen Briggs is the NetBSD/sandpoint port maintainer.  His porting
    efforts were sponsored by <a
    href="http://www.wasabisystems.com/">Wasabi Systems</a>; who've put
    out their own <a

<DATE>newdevelopers0312 12 Mar 2001 - New developers
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome three new developers:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Tamura Kent, <kent@NetBSD.org>, who is one of the most active
	developers of the <a href="http://chiharu.haun.org/peace/">PEACE
	Project</a>, an effort to provide a Win32 API implementation
	on NetBSD.  In the NetBSD Project, he will
	be working on reflecting their activity to the NetBSD Project,
	especially on the toolchain and development environment.
	<p>
    <li>Tomasz Luchowski, <zuntum@NetBSD.org>, who will help NetBSD by
	fixing bugs and adding new and exciting software to the <a
	href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
	Collection</a>.  In the past, he has contributed packages for
	various programs from Dan Bernstein (<PKGSRC>sysutils/daemontools,
	<PKGSRC>net/ucspi-tcp, <PKGSRC>net/djbdns; a package for qmail is
	on its way) and added patches to enable IPv6 on several packages.
	<p>
    <li>Andrei Petrov, <petrov@NetBSD.org>, who has already added FAS
	support to the ncr53c9x driver (which will be in the tree soon).
	Andrei will be mainly focusing on
	<a href="../Ports/sparc64/">NetBSD/sparc64</a>.
    </ul>

<DATE>compat-linux-ppc 12 Mar 2001 - Linux compatibility enabled for PowerPC ports
    Emmanuel Dreyfus has integrated the Linux
    compatibility feature for the NetBSD PowerPC ports (macppc, prep, bebox,
    ofppc, and amigappc). Linux compatibility on the PowerPC is still an
    experimental feature, but some real world applications such as Netscape
    Communicator already work. Now, it is time to crash test your favourite
    application and to report problems if you want the Linux compatibility
    to be really reliable.
    <p> 
    In order to enable Linux compatibility for NetBSD/PowerPC, you need to
    upgrade your kernel to NetBSD-current, rebuild it with the COMPAT_LINUX
    option, and install the emulators/linuxppc_lib package. More details are
    available at <a href="http://gizmo.minet.net:8080/emul_linux/">http://gizmo.minet.net:8080/emul_linux/</a>.

<DATE>ubc-usage-balancing 08 Mar 2001 - UBC memory usage-balancing code committed
    Chuck Silvers has committed <a
    href="../Documentation/kernel/#ubc">UBC</a> memory usage-balancing code to
    NetBSD-current.  Chuck's log message was as follows:
    <p>
    <dl><dd>
    "Add UBC memory-usage balancing.  We track the number of pages in use for
    each of the basic types (anonymous data, executable image, cached files)
    and prevent the pagedaemon from reusing a given page if that would reduce
    the count of that type of page below a sysctl-setable minimum threshold.
    The thresholds are controlled via three new sysctl tunables:
    vm.anonmin, vm.vnodemin, and vm.vtextmin.  These tunables are the
    percentages of pageable memory reserved for each usage, and we do not
    allow the sum of the minimums to be more than 95% so that there's always
    some memory that can be reused."
    </dd></dl>
    <p>
    This should fix a lot of the interactive performance problems that people
    have been reporting.  Hopefully the default settings for the new sysctl
    tunables will be reasonable for everyone, but if anyone finds that
    things are much better with different settings, please post about it
    to the <a href="../MailingLists/#tech-kern">tech-kern mailing list</a>.
    <p>
    If you experience problems, please send-pr(1) them.

vulnerabilities</a> found in previous versions, as well as featuring <a
href="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/docs/bind8.2_highlights.html">other
notable changes</a>.
<p>
Regarding pkgsrc, BIND 8.2.3/9.1.0 are now available. See the
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/net/bind8/README.html">bind8</a>/<PKGSRC>net/bind9
pages under the <a href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD
Packages Collection</a>.
<p>
<b>Update:</b> BIND has been upgraded to 8.2.3 on both the netbsd-1-4
and netbsd-1-5 branches.  This means that in addition to the next <a
href="../Releases/formal.html">major release</a> and <a
href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">pkgsrc</a>, this will also
be available in the 1.4.4 and 1.5.1 <a href="../Releases/formal.html">patch
releases</a> as well.

<DATE>lc-ctype 24 Jan 2001 - multibyte LC_CTYPE locale support
NetBSD-current has integrated multibyte LC_CTYPE locale support, from the
Citrus XPG4DL codebase.  
<p>
It currently supports both stateless and stateful multibyte encodings,
including:
<ul>
    <li> ISO2022 variant encodings, including iso-2022-jp and X11
         compound text
    <li> EUC variant encodings, including euc-jp, euc-kr, euc-cn
    <li> euc-tw encoding
    <li> MS kanji encoding, commonly used in Japanese MS-DOS arena
    <li> Big5, used commonly in Hongkong
    <li> UTF-2 and UTF-8
</ul>
<p>
We already have support for singlebyte encodings, like ISO-8859-1 or KOI8-R.
<p>
Now we should be able to start attacking other work areas, like wide
character stdio functions (like fgetwc), wide character curses/regex
functions, other locale types like LC_TIME and LC_COLLATE, more
locale definition files, and so forth.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> To avoid code footprint bloat, we disabled multibyte
LC_CTYPE locale support for statically linked binaries.  Statically
linked binaries can still enjoy singlebyte LC_CTYPE locale support
(like "fr_FR.ISO8859-1").  In the future, when NetBSD supports
dlopen() from within statically linked binaries, we may be able to
support multibyte LC_CTYPE locale from statically linked binaries.

<DATE>i386pkgs 10 Jan 2001 - 1.5/i386 pkg 2-CD set available
    The 3rd party software team of the NetBSD Project is proud to be able to
    provide a 2-CD-set with precompiled binary packages for the i386 port of
    NetBSD 1.5. The CDs are based on the NetBSD Packages Collection (pkgsrc)
    as of start of January 2001. At that time, pkgsrc included almost 1800
    applications ranging from shell tools over mail, web and other server
    software, various programming languages and a lot of programs for 
    scientific applications to productivity software like KDE and the GNOME
    desktop environments, the Mozilla web browser and the GNU image
    manipulation program, GIMP. Many applications are ready for IPv6 to
    explore the full potential of NetBSD 1.5.
    <p>

    Some of the highlights of this compilation include: Apache 1.3.14, BIND
    4/8/9, Civilisation Call To Power (demo version), Ghostscript 6.01, GNOME
    1.2.4, GNU Emacs 20.7, Heretic 2 (demo version), JDK 1.1.8, KDE 1.1.2,

<DATE>vpc 09 Jan 2001 - NetBSD and Virtual PC
    Connectix <a href="http://www.connectix.com/products/vpc.html">Virtual
    PC</a> is a PC emulator for Macs.  It emulates the behaviour of a fairly
    standard PC, including text mode video, graphics, and sound.  It's
    totally software based, and it acts like a computer similar to a PC.
    <p>
    Peter Seebach tried to get "VirtualPC with Linux" working with NetBSD,
    and found it was quite functional.  What does this mean?  It means you
    can run <a href="../Ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a>, either in a window or
    full-screen, under MacOS.
    <p>
    Peter contributed an image of NetBSD/i386 running on his PowerMac to
    the <a href="../gallery/in-Action/">NetBSD in action</a> gallery.
    Later he wrote an article for <a
    href="http://www.bsdtoday.com/">BSD Today</a> entitled <a
    href="http://www.bsdtoday.com/2000/November/Features326.html">BSD on
    Virtual PC</a>.  The article mainly focused on how usable it is, and
    had some more (very nice) screenshots.
    <p>
    Paul Hoffman has now created a web page entitled <a
    href="http://www.proper.com/vpc-netbsd/">Using NetBSD/i386 1.5 under
    Virtual PC 4</a>.  Paul covers installation and basic configuration,
    as well as any current problems you should know about.
    <p>
    Thank you to <a href="http://www.connectix.com/">Connectix</a> for their
    willingness to work with the BSD community.  The folks at Connectix did
    a fair amount of work between version 3 and version 4 to make NetBSD work
    better even though NetBSD is not officially supported by them.

<DATE>i4b 08 Jan 2001 - ISDN subsystem integrated
    The ISDN4BSD ISDN subsystem, which is also integrated into FreeBSD,
    has been brought into shape for NetBSD and imported into NetBSD-current.
    Drivers are available for a multitude of ISA, PCI, and PCMCIA cards.
    Currently only the EuroISDN (DSS1) variant is supported, which means
    there's some needed work for the protocol variants used in the U.S.
    <p>
    To use ISDN, you need NetBSD-current as of 20010108.  You may see
    the <a href="../Documentation/network/isdn/">Steps to connect via
    ISDN</a> in the <a href="../Documentation/">NetBSD Documentation</a>
    section for further instructions.  Also, a full set of documentation
    is available at the <a
    href="http://www.freebsd-support.de/i4b/">ISDN4BSD site</a>.
    <p>
    The NetBSD integration work was done by Martin Husemann.
    <p>
    <b>Update:</b> Amiga Zorro-Bus driver support for ISDN4BSD has
    been committed also.  To take advantage of this, you'll need
    NetBSD-current as of 20010122.  After that, the documentation
    links above will provide you with further instructions.

<DATE>sup_ftp_0112 08 Jan 2001 - NetBSD SUP/FTP tree will switch on Jan 12
    On January 12, the NetBSD SUP/FTP server configuration will switch as
    follows:
    <p>
    <b>FTP:</b>   
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li><tt>ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/</tt>
	<br>switches from netbsd-1-5 branch to main trunk (NetBSD-1.5Q or later)
	<p>
    <li><tt>ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release/</tt>
	<br>disappears
	<p>
    <li><tt>ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-5/</tt>
	<br>appears as netbsd-1-5 branch (NetBSD-1.5.1_ALPHA)
	<p>
    <li><tt>ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release-1-4/</tt>
	<br>appears as netbsd-1-4 branch (NetBSD-1.4.3A)
    </ul>
    <p>
    <b>SUP:</b>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li><tt>"current"</tt> collection
	<br>switches from netbsd-1-5 branch to main trunk (NetBSD-1.5Q or later)
	<p>
    <li><tt>"release"</tt> collection
	<br>disappears
	<p>
    <li><tt>"release-1-5"</tt> collection

	<p>
    <li><tt>"release-1-4"</tt> collection
	<br>appears as netbsd-1-4 branch (NetBSD-1.4.3A)
    </ul>
    <p>
    You will likely transfer many files due to this change.
    <p>
    <em>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</em> For those who use the "all" or "all-export"
    release of the SUP "mirror" collection, for the first SUP transfer
    after the switch, please use the "-o" option for the "sup" command or
    use "old" option for your SUP configuration file.  Also, it is not
    recommended to rename existing directories for those "all" or
    "all-export" users, unless you have a understanding of how SUP works
    (if you will rename the existing directories, you have to re-create
    SUP "last" file).

<DATE>hp300_elf 06 Jan 2001 - NetBSD/hp300 switches to ELF
    Simon Burge has committed changes to convert the <a
    href="../Ports/hp300/">NetBSD/hp300</a> port to ELF.  With the
    COMPAT_AOUT_M68K kernel option, all your old a.out binaries should
    still work.  Note that a.out versions of ifconfig<b></b>(8) and
    route<b></b>(8) will <em>not</em> work due to some structure
    alignment problems.
    <p>
    The instructions that Steve Woodford put together when the <a
    href="../Ports/mvme68k/">NetBSD/mvme68k</a> port switched to ELF should
    also apply as far as building the toolchain for NetBSD/hp300.  A modified
    version of those instructions can be found at:
    <p> 
    <blockquote>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/hp300/snapshot/elf-upgrade/README.ELF-UPGRADE">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/hp300/snapshot/elf-upgrade/README.ELF-UPGRADE</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p> 
    Also, a complete -current snapshot, with all these changes incorporated
    is available at:

<DATE>port-dreamcast 05 Jan 2001 - SEGA Dreamcast port and mailing list
    In July, Saitoh Masanobu <msaitoh@NetBSD.org>, a developer in Japan,
    successfully booted the NetBSD kernel on his Dreamcast, a game console
    made by SEGA Corporation.  The port used was the NetBSD/evbsh3 port
    for evaluation boards using the Super-H processor family also used in
    the SEGA Dreamcast.  Although this port contained no code specific to
    the Dreamcast, the fact that the CPU contained builtin peripheral
    modules such as timers and serial ports meant that the generic code
    could still make a working system with a serial port console.
    <p>
    The Dreamcast port has now been split from the NetBSD/evbsh3 port into
    a port in its own right.  This means that the work on support for
    Dreamcast-specific hardware can now begin.  The Dreamcast port can boot
    up in single-user mode from a ramdisk (and play Rogue!), but since the
    serial port is still the only supported hardware device, it is not yet
    very useful to end users.  Please see below for a current dmesg
    output.
    <p>
    The NetBSD/dreamcast port has been made possible by the developers of
    NetBSD/sh3:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Saitoh Masanobu <msaitoh@NetBSD.org>: main developer
    <li>Jun-ichiro "itojun" Hagino <itojun@NetBSD.org>: port maintainer
    </ul>
    <p>
    If you're interested in keeping up-to-date on the progress of this port,
    or in becoming a part of the development efforts, there's now a separate
    mailing list for the Dreamcast: port-dreamcast@NetBSD.org.  This list can
    be subscribed to either on the
    <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/MailingLists/#port-dreamcast">NetBSD web
    site</a> or by sending a mail with the body of "subscribe port-dreamcast"
    to majordomo@NetBSD.org.  More information will soon be available on the
    <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/Ports/dreamcast/">NetBSD/dreamcast port
    page</a>.

<DATE>sushi 04 Jan 2001 - Sushi, a user administration tool for NetBSD
    Tim Rightnour has written and imported sushi - an interactive, menu-based
    program that is designed to aid the user or administrator with
    administrative and complex tasks on their machines.
    <p>
    Sushi provides a menu of various functions that the user can perform on
    his or her machine.  Once the user selects a desired function, the
    function is either performed outright, or in most cases, the user is
    asked to fill in a simple form with required and optional information,
    which is then processed by sushi, and the action occurs.
    <p>
    The programming interface for sushi is very simple.  There are
    directories containing various files, such as menu indexes, or forms for
    the user to fill out.  These files are interpreted by sushi to generate
    the menus the user sees on his/her screen.  When the form is filled out
    by the user, the entries are passed as command-line arguments to a
    program, or script contained in one of the subdirectories.  In this way,
    it is possible to add new entries to the sushi menu structure, by simply
    adding a new menu item, form and script, the binary does not need to be
    recompiled to take advantage of this new menu.
    <p>
    <b>Update:</b> People interested in trying sushi out on their machines
    will need to upgrade their machines to -current as of 01/06/2001 (or wait
    for the next -current snapshot).  A number of extensive changes in
    libcurses were made, as well as the addition of the CDK and libform
    supporting libraries.  The binary itself is installed into /usr/sbin, and
    the menu structures are installed into /usr/share/sushi.  The menu
    structures will be installed normally as part of a make build, out of
    the sharesrc CVS module.
    <p>
    If you do try out this development version of sushi, please send any
    problem reports via send-pr(1).  If you wish to develop menu items for
    sushi, these may be submitted via send-pr(1) as well.

<DATE>libform 04 Jan 2001 - Curses based forms library
    Brett Lymn has implemented the a curses base forms library which 
    forms part of the ETI suite of libraries (originally done by AT&amp;T).
    This library provides a terminal independent forms interface for
    character terminals.

<DATE>next68k-scsi 27 Dec 2000 - NetBSD/next68k SCSI support update
    Darrin B. Jewell has spent some time reviving the SCSI effort for
    NetBSD/next68k.  At this point, he's using a SCSI mounted root
    partition and things seem to be working.
    <p>
    Darrin has uploaded diffs relative to the netbsd-1-5-RELEASE tree
    at:
    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/next68k/scsi-20001226/scsi-20001226.diffs">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/next68k/scsi-20001226/scsi-20001226.diffs</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    He has also uploaded a GENERIC kernel with scsi enabled that he is now
    successfully using at:
    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/next68k/scsi-20001226/netbsd.gz">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/next68k/scsi-20001226/netbsd.gz</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Darrin will try to merge these into -current and possibly pull them up to
    the 1.5 branch in the near future.  There is additional work to do, such
    as getting a more functional disklabel(8) and installboot(8)
    going.  There are certainly still driver kinks that will need to be
    ironed out, but it seems we're over the hump.  If anyone is interested in
    picking up some of these pieces and hacking on them, please do.

    commercial entity, with all the resources it can provide, this
    closely associated with the NetBSD Project.
    <p>
    We look forward to continued contributions, both technical and
    otherwise, from Wasabi and their team.

<DATE>plex86 14 Dec 2000 - plex86 working on NetBSD/i386
    The virtual x86 machine emulator 'plex86' now works on a
    second Open Source operating system.  So far plex86 did only
    support Linux as host platform, and thanks to Frank van der
    Linden of Wasabi Systems (<a
    href="http://www.wasabisystems.com/">http://www.wasabisystems.com/</a>),
    it now also works on the i386 port of the NetBSD multi-platform
    operating system.
    <p>
    Tested operating systems include FreeDOS beta 4, MS-DOS 6.22,
    Red Hat 6 Linux and NetBSD 1.5, stay tuned for more to come.
    Instead of doing full CPU instruction emulation, Plex86 runs
    native i386 code at full CPU speed, and only intercepts the
    code for system calls into the host platform as well as
    instructions that modify the machine state like trap or IO
    operations. Simply speaking, it is an open source version
    VMWare.
    <p>
    Plex86 is currently still in early stages, so speed and device
    support are items that need improvement. However, they are
    being worked on by its creator, Kevin Lawton.
    <p>
    The changes for NetBSD have been sent to him, and will
    hopefully be integrated soon.  To learn more about plex86, visit

<DATE>emul_lkm 12 Dec 2000 - Infrastructure to load emulations via LKM in NetBSD-current
    Jarom&iacute;r Dolecek has added an infrastructure to the kernel for
    loading emulations and support for executing emulation binaries via LKM.
    This means that e.g. Linux or FreeBSD compat code is now dynamically
    loadable and the support for running respective binaries can be added in
    runtime.
    <p>
    The build infrastructure is there for all support emulations and
    compatibility exec formats under sys/lkm/{compat|exec}/*.  It has only
    been tested for Linux/ELF emulation on i386 so far.  Other LKMs are built,
    but not installed yet, since they haven't been tested.
    <p>
    If you find any other compat or exec LKMs working, please use send-pr(1)
    so that it gets enabled (or, if it's not working, so it can be fixed).
    <p>
    The full text of Jarom&iacute;r's announcement is available in the <a

<DATE>802.11_powersave 11 Dec 2000 - 802.11 power management frobbing with ifconfig
    Jason Thorpe has committed a 'powersave' command to ifconfig(8) so
    that you can manipulate power management parameters of 802.11 devices.
    This was something you could already do with wiconfig(8), but:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>ifconfig(8) is what /etc/rc uses, etc.
    <li>It's specified by 802.11, so other cards may support it
    </ol>
    <p>
    Jason has modified the wi(4) driver to understand it.  People with
    other card types will want to investigate support in their cards.

<DATE>mvme68k_elf 07 Dec 2000 - NetBSD/mvme68k switches to ELF
    Steven Woodford has switched NetBSD/mvme68k over to using ELF as its
    native object file format, and gas.new/ld.new as its assembler and
    linker respectively.  NetBSD/mvme68k is NetBSD's port to Motorola's
    MVME-1xx range of single board computers.
    <p>
    Further details are available on the <a

<DATE>ncr53c9x 30 Nov 2000 - Updated ncr53c9x driver
    Eduardo Horvath has added TAG QUEUE support to the ncr53c9x driver in
    NetBSD-current.  See Eduardo's announcement in the <a

<DATE>ubc-code 27 Nov 2000 - UBC code integrated into NetBSD-current
Chuck Silvers has integrated the Unified Buffer Cache project code into
NetBSD-current.  To build a new -current kernel from an
existing kernel configuration file, you'll want to remove any settings for
"BUFCACHE", "NBUF", or "BUFPAGES", and let the size of the buffer cache go
back to the default.  After that, you'll need to rerun <tt>config</tt>, and
then you can build away.
<p>
Under UBC, the traditional buffer cache is no longer used for storing regular
data, only metadata, so you'll want to allow the VM system to manage most of
your physical memory.  The default buffer cache size will be fine for most
people, regardless of the amount of memory in the machine.
<p>
What does this mean for you?  For most people, more memory will be available
for caching regular file data, so filesystem i/o will be faster since there
will be more times when the data you're accessing is already in memory.  How
much faster depends on what you're doing, but you'll probably notice the
difference.
<p>
More information is available in Chuck's announcement in the <a

<DATE>netbsd_1.4.3 25 Nov 2000 - NetBSD 1.4.3 Released
The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.4.3.
<p>

This release fixes problems found in the earlier 1.4.x family of
releases, improves stability, and includes support for new hardware.
NetBSD 1.4.3 is a patch release of the 1.4 release branch.  The 1.5
release branch will have its major release, NetBSD 1.5, shortly.
<p>

The release binaries and source for NetBSD 1.4.3 are available now.
The pc532 and atari ports will be available in source form only for
1.4.3, but both will have release binaries for 1.5.
<p>

This release contains a number of new features which have been imported
from the main NetBSD development branch since NetBSD 1.4.2, including:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>A driver for the Lucent Wavelan (Orinoco) 802.11B wireless
      Ethernet PCMCIA card has been added, see wi(4).
  <li>The PCI Cyclom-4Y and -8Y multiport serial cards are now supported.
  <li>The Macintosh LC Ethernet Adapter is now supported.
  <li>The on-board video on Macintosh Quadra 605 is now supported.
  <li>Bugfixes to the Alteon Gigabit Ethernet driver, ti(4).
  <li>Support for several new PCI IDE controllers have been added, see
      pciide(4).
  <li>The i386 port may now be installed on wd2 or wd3.
  <li>A possible CPU hog problem related to large I/Os has been fixed.
      Fixes SA#2000-005
  <li>A denial-of-service problem related to handling of IP options
      has been fixed.  Fixes SA#2000-002.
  <li>A problem with /etc/ftpchroot has been fixed.  Fixes SA#2000-006.
  <li>A minor problem related to locking of semaphore resources has
      been fixed.  Fixes SA#2000-004.
  <li>The DHCP software has been updated to ISC 2.0pl3.  This also fixes
      SA#2000-008 -- a security problem in the dhcp client code.
  <li>A problem with use of user-supplied data as a format string in
      ftpd has been fixed.  Fixes SA#2000-009.
  <li>The sparc c++rt0.o code is now compiled with -fPIC.  This means
      that libraries with global constructors (which must link in
      c++rt0.o on sparc/a.out) must also be compiled -fPIC.
  <li>Most countries can now import the full release without restriction,
      including the previously restricted 'domestic' portion. The only
      "problem spots" are US-embargoed countries.  Full details are
      available at <a
      href="../Misc/crypto-export.html">http://www.NetBSD.org/Misc/crypto-export.html</a>
  <li>An extensive audit of the code (and corresponding fixes) has
      been done to eliminate possible buffer overruns caused by
      possible user-specified format strings.
</ul>
<p>

In addition, many bugs have been fixed -- more than 70 problems
reported through our problem tracking system have been fixed, and
NetBSD 1.4.3 also contains fixes for other non-reported problems that
were found during the 1.4.3 release cycle.
<p>

<DATE>structemul 21 Nov 2000 - Changes in struct emul and execsw[]
    Jarom&iacute;r Dolecek has committed some changes to restructure
    struct emul and execsw in the NetBSD-current tree.  These changes
    are part of an effort to make emulations loadable via LKM.
    <p>
    The changes are quite extensive, though should not cause any problems.
    More details are available in Jarom&iacute;r's commit message in the <a

<DATE>ftpd-0011 17 Nov 2000 - Recent ftpd enhancements
    Luke Mewburn has been improving ftpd lately.  What follows is a list  
    of recent changes:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Add ftpd.conf(5) directives:
	<ul>
	<li>'<tt>maxfilesize</tt>' - limit maximum size of upload files
	<li>'<tt>sanenames</tt>' - only permit uploaded filenames that don't
	    start with '.' and only contain '[-+,._A-Za-z0-9]'
	</ul> 
    <p>
    </li>
    <li>New command line options:
	<ul>
	<li>'<tt>-P dataport</tt>' - different dataport
	<li>'<tt>-q</tt>' - enable pidfiles (default)
	<li>'<tt>-Q</tt>' - disable pidfiles
	<li>'<tt>-u</tt>' - write utmp
	<li>'<tt>-U</tt>' - don't write utmp (default)
	<li>'<tt>-w</tt>' - write wtmp (default)
	<li>'<tt>-W</tt>' - don't write wtmp
	</ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Note: -U meaning has changed from "write utmp" to "<em>don't</em> write
    utmp" to be consistent with -q/-Q and -w/-W.  Old use of -U won't enable
    an unwanted feature, it just won't enable a wanted feature.

<DATE>i2o 08 Nov 2000 - Support for I2O adapters in NetBSD-current
    Andrew Doran has added support for I2O adapters to NetBSD-current.

<DATE>rijndael 04 Oct 2000 - AES (rijndael) support in NetBSD-current IPsec code
        NetBSD-current IPsec (from KAME) now supports rijndael algorithm for
        ESP encryption, thanks to the integration work of Jun-ichiro itojun
        Hagino. rijndael is the finalist of AES contest, and
        will be standardized in FIPS standard suite, to replace DES.
	<p>
        AES finalist was picked on Oct 2, the official algorithm number is
        decided on Oct 3.  NetBSD-current has working rijndael support since
        Oct 3 (the foundation has been there waiting for algorithm number).
	<p>
        The implementation is known to be interoperable with others.
        Also, it is possible to negotiate rijndael IPsec SA by using the
        latest racoon IKE daemon (pkgsrc/security/racoon, be sure to get
        version 20001004a).

	The change is now in 1.5 branch, and will be available in 1.5 release.

<DATE>ssh 28 Sep 2000 - Secure Shell now in mainline
    Jason Thorpe has committed an OpenSSH-based Secure Shell to the main
    NetBSD sources.  This will be pulled into the netbsd-1-5 branch, so it
    will be available in NetBSD 1.5.
    <p>
    Please note that the OpenSSH-based implementation is a temporary measure;
    it will be replaced with a completely independent implementation as soon
    as that other implementation is ready (within the next couple of months
    it is hoped).

<DATE>vlan 28 Sep 2000 - 802.1Q VLAN support in NetBSD-current

    on some additional integration cleanup.

<DATE>agc0009 12 Sep 2000 - Changes to the NetBSD Packages Collection in August 2000
    Alistair G. Crooks has sent out his monthly summary of changes to the 
    NetBSD Packages Collection.  The write up for changes in August 2000 is 
    available in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/netbsd-announce/2000/09/12/0000.html">netbsd-announce
    mail archive</a>.
    <p> 
    There is also an automated list of pkgsrc changes, generated daily from
    <CURRENTSRC>pkgsrc/doc/CHANGES, available on the <a
    href="pkg-changes.html">Recent packages changes</a> page.

<DATE>pty-structs 11 Sep 2000 - Change in kernel pty structures allocation
   Jarom&iacute;r Dolecek has changed the way pty structs are allocated in
   NetBSD-current.  It's now allocated at run-time, allowing support for
   an arbitrary number of ptys without the need of a kernel recompile.
   <p>
   The value was previously set in a kernel config via:
   <p>
   <dl><dd>
   pseudo-device pty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>foo</i>
   </dd></dl>
   <p>
   This now does not mean that the fixed number <i>foo</i> is available, but
   rather how big is the array of pointers to pty structs on the start.  If
   <i>foo</i> is omitted, 64 is used.  This initial array is enlarged as
   necessary.
   <p>
   Also, there's a new sysctl, kern.maxptys, which limits how many maximum
   pty's might exist.  This defaults to 512.  Note that one would need to
   install newer kernel includes and rebuild sysctl(8) for it to
   support kern.maxptys.
   <p>
   The full text of Jarom&iacute;r's announcement is available in the <a
   href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2000/09/09/0015.html">current-users
   mail archive</a>.

<DATE>rssinternal 10 Sep 2000 - List of NetBSD code changes now available in XML/RSS format
   The NetBSD Project is proud to offer another News Channel for content
   providers and users.  The new channel, 'NetBSD Code Changes', will list
   significant source changes (such
   as newly added features in both kernel and userland), updated programs in
   the base system, ports to new architectures, and more.
   <p>
   The 'NetBSD Code Changes' RSS file is available at the following URL:
   <p>
   <dl><dd>
   <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/Changes/rss-netbsd-internals.xml">http://www.NetBSD.org/Changes/rss-netbsd-internals.xml</a>
   </dd></dl>
   <p>
   More information on this, and the other two channels, is available on the
   <a href="rss.html">NetBSD News Channels</a> page.

<DATE>largepages 07 Sep 2000 - Initial support for large pages
    Jason Thorpe has added support for mapping the kernel text using large
    pages to NetBSD-current/i386.  This gives a reasonable performance
    improvement.  For example, building a GENERIC kernel on a 600MHz P-III
    laptop:
    <p>
    <dl><dd>
    before: 636.59s real   387.34s user    27.53s system
    <p>
    after: 597.21s real   382.88s user    24.88s system
    </dd></dl>
    <p>
    Note that compiling stuff is userland-intensive, so things that spend a
    lot more time in the kernel (e.g forwarding packets, IPsec processing,
    RAIDframe, etc.) are likely to see better improvements.
    <p>
    This is initial support for large pages, so there is <b>not</b> generic
    support for using large pages for other types of mappings yet, nor is
    there support for mapping the kernel data/bss segments with large pages
    (although that should be pretty straightforward).
    <p>
    An example kernel config can be found in <CURRENTSRC>sys/arch/i386/conf/DR-EVIL.4MB.
    Follow its lead to learn how to enable large page support.
    <p>
    This initial support was developed at and contributed by <a
    href="http://www.zembu.com/">Zembu Labs, Inc</a>. 

<DATE>mipsco 06 Sep 2000 - Port for MIPS Computer Systems Inc. family of workstations and servers
    In July, Wayne Knowles <wdk@NetBSD.org>, a researcher in New Zealand,
    successfully ported NetBSD to his RC3230 made by MIPS Computer Systems,
    Inc.  The RC3230 was a R3000A desktop box commonly called R3000 Magnum;
    a popular workstation that was re-badged by companies such as Bull and
    Olivetti.  The port name was decided to be NetBSD/mipsco so other computers
    by MIPS Computer Systems could be included in it.
    <p>
    In early August, NetBSD/mipsco was merged into the main NetBSD tree, and
    has seen many improvements since.  Changes were committed to allow the
    kernel to read either a BSD disklabel created under NetBSD/sparc or a
    MIPS volume header created under Risc OS.  This change allowed the stand
    alone shell to directly load a NetBSD kernel and mount a filesystem -
    NetBSD/mipsco became self-sufficient.
    <p>
    Currently the Magnum 3000, Mips 3230 Server, and Bull DPX/Prostation M-20
    are supported.  Support for other models is planned for the future.
    <p>
    The following persons helped greatly in the process of creating this port:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Wayne Knowles: port maintainer and main developer
    <li>Toru Nishimura: developer
    <li>Francis Bogsanyi and Chris Collins: provided feedback from the
        pre-alpha snapshot
    </ul>
    <p>
    If you're interested in following
    or becoming a part of the development efforts, there's a port-mipsco
    mailing list.  This list can be subscribed to either on the <a
    href="../MailingLists/#port-mipsco">NetBSD web site</a> or by sending
    a mail with the body of "subscribe port-mipsco" to majordomo@NetBSD.org.
    More information is also available on the <a
    href="../Ports/mipsco/">NetBSD/mipsco</a> port page.

<DATE>mvme162 06 Sep 2000 - Support for MVME162-LX 200/300 in NetBSD/mvme68k
    Steve Woodford has added preliminary support for the LX 200/300 variants of 
    <a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=16&amp;ProductID=2&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME162</a>
    to NetBSD/mvme68k.
    <p>
    Currently, the major onboard devices are supported (disk, network,
    rs232 and VMEbus). However, work is still need to support the remaining
    devices (e.g IndustryPack sites).
    <p>
    These boards are available with a dazzling array of build options. At
    this time, the following options are <em>required</em>:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Real floating point hardware (the 68LC040 model isn't tested).
    <li>The VMEchip2 must be present.
    <li>If offboard VMEbus RAM is not present, at least 8MB of onboard
	  RAM is required.
    <li>Even if offboard VMEbus RAM <em>is</em> present, at least 4MB of onboard
	  RAM is required (Boards with 1 or 2MB onboard RAM <em>can</em> be
	  supported with offboard RAM, but not without some funky values in
	  the VMEbus Master mapping registers).
    </ul>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.salientsystems.com/">Salient Systems</a> provided
    hardware to Steve which made this support possible.
    <p>
    More information about NetBSD/mvme68k is available in the <a
    href="../Ports/mvme68k/">NetBSD/mvme68k</a> pages.
    <p>
    <b>Update:</b> This support has been pulled into the netbsd-1-5 branch, so
    it will be available in NetBSD 1.5.

<DATE>embedded-powerpc 02 Sep 2000 - Embedded PowerPC Port started

<DATE>exper-sparc64-snapshot 26 Jul 2000 - Experimental sparc64 shared library snapshot
    Charles Hannum has uploaded an experimental NetBSD/sparc64 snapshot with
    shared libraries.  This is just a big tar file of the whole installation,
    with a kernel in /netbsd.  The snapshot is located at
    <URL>ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/incoming/mycroft/sparc64.tgz
    <p>
    A few things to note:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>This snapshot was cross-compiled from i386-netbsdelf.  The compiler
	it contains is egcs 1.1.2, which is <b>not recommended</b> for
	sparc64.  There should be a native gcc 2.95.2 build working soon.
    <li>The snapshot does not contain hack(6), because it fails to build due
	to a cross-compiler bug.
    <li>There appear to be problems with tcpdump and krb5.  They'll be looked
	into soon.
    <li>It is, as stated, experimental.  As so, there's a chance it will
	break.
    </ul>
    <p>
    If you do try it, please report any problems you have to the
    <a href="../MailingLists/#port-sparc64">port-sparc64</a> mailing list.

<DATE>nwkey-support 21 Jul 2000 - Support for nwkey added to ifconfig for 802.11
    Atsushi Onoe has committed changes to NetBSD-current for nwkey keyword
    support in ifconfig(8) for IEEE 802.11 devices.  The available drivers are
    wi (WaveLAN and PRISM-II), and awi (AMD/PRISM-I), for now.
    <p>
    Here is the usage from the updated man page:
    <p>
    <dl><dd>
    <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr>
    <td valign=top>nwkey&nbsp;key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>(IEEE 802.11 devices only) Enable WEP encryption for IEEE
    802.11-based wireless network interfaces with the key.
    The key can either be a string, a series of hexadecimal
    digits, or a set of keys in the form n:k1,k2,k3,k4, where
    n specifies which of keys will be used for all transmitted
    packets, and four keys, k1 through k4, are configured
    as WEP keys.  Note that the order must be match within
    same network if multiple keys are used.<br>&nbsp;<br></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td valign=top>-nwkey&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>(IEEE 802.11 devices only) Disable WEP encryption for
    IEEE 802.11-based wireless network interfaces.</td>
    </tr></table>
    </dd></dl>
    <p>
    These changes have been pulled into the netbsd-1-5 branch, so
    this will be available in NetBSD 1.5.

<DATE>dreamcast-preannounce 15 Jul 2000 - Progress on port to Sega's Dreamcast game console

<DATE>alpha-jensen 14 Jul 2000 - Support for Jensen systems in NetBSD/alpha  
    Jason Thorpe has gotten the Jensen systems (DECpc AXP 150 a.k.a DEC
    2000/300) working, thanks to some testing help from Gyenes Istvan.
    There was a kernel configuration error in the INSTALL kernel that
    prevented Jensen SCSI from working, but that has since been fixed and
    the code has been committed.
    <p>
    This support has been pulled into the netbsd-1-5 branch so that NetBSD 1.5
    will work on Jensen systems.

<DATE>developer-resources 10 Jul 2000 - NetBSD Developer Resources page
    NetBSD has a specific build lab for 'full' developers, but it can
    sometimes be difficult for others who would like to test and develop
    software on the wide range of machines supported by NetBSD to do so.
    <p>
    In response to this, Rick Kelly, <rmk@rmkhome.com>, has created the <a
    href="http://www.rmkhome.com/NetBSD/">NetBSD Developer Resources</a>
    page, which lists NetBSD users who will donate time on their machines
    to increase awareness of NetBSD and widen the pool of available software
    for the OS.  The entries on the page consist of the users name, e-mail
    address, and a listing of computer models available to developers.

    script and replacement library for systems which don't have NetBSD-specific
    library functions.
    <p>
    The major changes with this version are various fixes to the IPv6
    support, the use of 'LIST' instead of 'NLST' with the ls command, support
    for uploading files on the command line with '-u', the addition of fget
    (which reads a list of files to retrieve from a given file), and
    portability fixes.

<DATE>wasabisystems 30 Jun 2000 - Support for NetBSD from Wasabi Systems, Inc.
    Wasabi Systems is a new company, founded by members of the NetBSD Project
    and a team of experienced consultants and business services providers,
    that will offer commercial-grade NetBSD sales, support, and service.
    <p>
    There has been a lot of talk and excitement since Wasabi commenced
    operations on June 21st, and what follows is a brief outline of their
    goals and what they're doing.
    <p>
    Perry Metzger, President and CEO of Wasabi, said, "Support is the key.
    You can't go NetBSD if going NetBSD means going it alone.  And yet until
    now, no company has stood behind NetBSD and offered complete NetBSD
    customizations, support packages, and commercial-grade consulting
    solutions.  Wasabi will bring the highest-caliber NetBSD developers and
    consultants to every job we do, from mailservers to MIPS boxes, firewalls
    to food processors."
    <p>
    Wasabi Systems is the premier source for commercial NetBSD support and
    customization services, and offers a range of integrated NetBSD system
    solutions, focusing on the Internet server appliance and embedded systems
    markets.
    <p>
    Wasabi will also offer NetBSD support packages, training and certification
    programs, and related NetBSD products.  In the summer of 2000, Wasabi
    plans to release a limited edition of NetBSD 1.4.3 CD-ROMs, which will be
    followed by the full release of Wasabi NetBSD 1.5 in the fall.
    <p>

<DATE>sgimips-announce 30 Jun 2000 - NetBSD Port available for SGI Platform
    The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that the NetBSD/sgimips port
    has reached a state where it is stable enough to run multi-user
    mode. This makes NetBSD the world's first Open Source operating system
    running on the Silicon Graphics O2, code for the Indy machines will be
    available soon.  Utilizing NetBSD's machine independent driver
    framework, the port currently supports most of the usual NetBSD PCI
    drivers, including the machine's internal SCSI controller. Machines
    with the R5000 CPU are known to work, R10k and R12k are untested due
    to lack of hardware (contact <soren@NetBSD.org> for arranging hardware
    donations).
    <P>
    The following persons made this port possible:
    <P>
     <UL>
     <LI> Soren Jorvang: port maintainer and main developer
     <LI> Antti Kantee, Helsinki University of Technology: providing access
          to O2 hardware
     <LI> Herb Peyerl, the NetBSD Build Lab:  providing access to O2 hardware
     <LI> Chan Wilson, Silicon Graphics, Inc.: Indy hardware donation
     </UL>
    <P>

    If you have questions or want to participate in development of the the
    NetBSD/sgimips port, feel free to join our mailing list: write mail
    with "subscribe sgimips" in the body to majordomo@NetBSD.org, and send
    back the authentication mail you'll get. An archive of the mailing  
    list can be found at <A HREF="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/port-sgimips/">http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/port-sgimips/</A>.

<DATE>newdevelopers0626 26 Jun 2000 - New developers
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome two new developers:
    <ul>
    <li>Shuichiro URATA, <ur@NetBSD.org>, who has already contributed kernel
    softfloat emulation code to the hpcmips port and support for the NEC
    RISCstation 2250 and its PCI for the arc port.  He will be working on
    improving various aspects of NetBSD's arc and other mips ports.
    <li>Takuya Shiozaki, <tshiozak@NetBSD.org>, who is the main programmer of
    the Citrus Project, which is an effort to implement the
    internationalization framework (a.k.a. locale) for *BSD.  He will be
    working on integrating this framework with NetBSD.
    </ul>

<DATE>salibdes 21 Jun 2000 - Security Advisory 2000-007 released
    <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2000-007.txt.asc">
    NetBSD-SA2000-007</a> has been released, reporting a problem with
    random key generation in libdes in the domestic version of
    NetBSD-current if /dev/urandom is not in use.  The problem has
    been corrected in -current and was not present in any formal release 
    of NetBSD.

    <p> More information on previous <a
    href="../Security/advisory.html">security advisories</a> is
    available in the NetBSD <a href="../Security/">
    security</a> pages.


<DATE>1.5releasecycle 20 Jun 2000 - NetBSD 1.5 release cycle started
    Today, the release cycle for NetBSD 1.5 has started. The NetBSD 1.5
    release is scheduled for early fall this year. Of course, we want
    this to be the best NetBSD release ever, as with every release.
    To help achieve this goal, you can test the ALPHA and BETA snapshots
    that will be made available, or track the release branch sources.
    <p>
    If you want to use the NetBSD 1.5 branch source code using anoncvs,
    update your source tree using the "-r netbsd-1-5" flag to the cvs
    "update" command, or check out a separate tree using this flag to
    the "checkout" command. To be sure that you get the 1.5 branch, you
    should always use the "-r netbsd-1-5" flag.
    <p>
    For people tracking -current using SUP: the -current sources on the
    NetBSD ftp and SUP servers will track the 1.5 release branch during
    the release cycle, so no extra action is required to get the 1.5
    branch sources.

<DATE>softdepsmount 17 Jun 2000 - Soft updates mount change
    Frank van der Linden has changed the way that soft updates are
    enabled and disabled.  This is now done via a mount option (-o softdep).
    It can no longer be done via tunefs, after you have recompiled it.
    <p>
    If you are using soft updates, and want to upgrade your kernel,
    you should:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Compile and run a new kernel with "options SOFTDEP" in its config 
        file.
    <li>Update mount(8) and mount_ffs(8)
    <li>Boot your new kernel single user
    <li>Use the old tunefs to disable soft updates on any filesystem
        you may have set it: "<i>tunefs -n disable /dev/rXdoX</i>".
    <li>Continue booting
    <li>Enable the softdep option in /etc/fstab for the filesystems that you
        want it to be active on.
    <li>Reboot again
    </ol>
    <p>
    Full instructions on how to enable soft updates are located in the <a
    href="../Documentation/misc/#softdeps">How to use soft
    updates</a> FAQ entry.

<DATE>rpcbugfix 13 Jun 2000 - Important RPC bugfix
    Jason Thorpe has fixed a serious problem with the new TI-RPC code.  His
    fix makes the RPC mem_alloc() macro use calloc() to prevent RPC from
    using only partially-initiated data structures.  If you've attempted to
    upgrade to the new RPC code, you should update your sources as soon as you
    can, rebuild your libc, and then rebuild world.
    <p>

<DATE>hpt366 12 Jun 2000 - Support for the HighPoint HPT366 IDE Controller
    Manuel Bouyer has committed support to NetBSD-current for the HighPoint
    HPT366 IDE Controller.  It should work properly with both standard and
    Ultra/66 cables.  Support for the HPT370 was also added, but is untested
    as of this moment.  If you have any problems please report them with
    send-pr(1). 

<DATE>newdevelopers0605 05 Jun 2000 - New developers
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome three new developers:
    <ul>
    <li>Adam Ciarcinski, who will be working on the AmigaPPC port.
    <li>Andreas Gustafsson, who will be working on various bits, including
    pcmcia, wireless, pthreads, and general hacking both in and out of the
    kernel. 
    <li>Federico Lupi, who has already written a large amount of documentation
    (in the form of the <a href="../Documentation/">NetBSD
    Guide</a>), and will be working on integrating it with NetBSD's current
    documentation and expanding it to cover even more subjects. 
    </ul>

<DATE>newrpccode 03 Jun 2000 - New RPC code added to the tree
	Frank van der Linden has modified NetBSD's RPC code (the library code,
	rpcinfo and rpcbind) to be based on the "<a href="http://www.as400.ibm.com/developer/tirpc/">TI-RPC</a>"
        interface, Sun's second-generation RPC code.
	<p>
	Not all applications have been adapted to the new interface yet, but
	they will continue to work because the old interface is still there
	for backward compatibility.
	<p>
	Further details (including instructions on how to upgrade) are
	available in Frank's announcement in the <a
	href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2000/06/03/0000.html">current-users
	mail archive.</a>  <b>Update:</b> On June 4th, Jason Thorpe fixed a
	serious bug with the new RPC code that prevented programs from reliably
        communicating with rpcbind(8); an uninitialized variable kept a
	necessary socket option from being enabled.  If you've updated after
	the point when the new TI-RPC code went into the tree and before
	Jason's fix, you really want to update your libc as soon as you can.

<DATE>new_sysctls 03 Jun 2000 - Recent sysctls added
	Simon Burge has added some new sysctls to help abolish the dreaded
	"proc size mismatch" errors from ps(1) and some other kernel
	grovellers, and also to return some data that has previously only been
	accessible with /dev/kmem read access.  The sysctls are:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>KERN_PROC2 - return an array of fixed sized "struct kinfo_proc2"
	structures that contain most of the useful user-level data in
	"struct proc" and "struct user".  The sysctl also takes the size of
	each element, so that if "struct kinfo_proc2" grows over time old
	binaries will still be able to request a fixed size amount of data.
	<li>KERN_PROC_ARGS - return the argv or envv for a particular process
	id.  envv will only be returned if the process has the same user id as
	the requester or if the requester is root.
	<li>KERN_FSCALE - return the current kernel fixpt scale factor.
	<li>KERN_CCPU - return the scheduler exponential decay value.
	<li>KERN_CP_TIME - return cpu time state counters.
	</ul>
	<p>
	With input and suggestions from many people on tech-kern. 

<DATE>alphaup1000 02 Jun 2000 - Support for Alpha Processor, Inc. UP1000
	Jason Thorpe has added support for the Alpha Processor, Inc. UP1000
	system.  The UP1000 is a PC-like board with an EV6 and the AMD 751
	core logic chipset (same as is used on AMD Athlon systems).  SRM
	console software is available for it.
	<p>
	Many thanks to
	<a href="http://www.alpha-processor.com/">Alpha Processor, Inc.</a>
	for supplying a board with which to do the port.
	<p>
	See the <a href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a> pages for more
	information about NetBSD/alpha.

<DATE>amigappc0 26 May 2000 - Initial NetBSD/amigappc code
	The first mostly-demo kernel of NetBSD/Amigappc can now be built
	from the -current sources, using the compiler and tools from the
	cross-powerpc package. This is work by Adam Ciarcinski with some
	help from Ignatios Souvatzis and valuable input from other
	NetBSD/powerpc ports.

<DATE>newdevelopers0523 23 May 2000 - New developers
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome two new developers:
    <ul>
    <li>Gregory McGarry, <gmcgarry@NetBSD.org>, who has already contributed
    audio device drivers, MCA device drivers, and PCMCIA code, and will be 
    continuing work on miscellaneous drivers.
    <li>Bernardo Innocenti, <bernie@NetBSD.org>, who has already enhanced the
    Amiga mainboard-audio driver, and will initially be working on integrating
    sysinst support for NetBSD/Amiga.
    </ul>

<DATE>cyclades-z 18 May 2000 - Driver for Cyclades-Z intelligent multiport serial adapters
    Jason Thorpe has committed a driver for the Cyclades-Z intelligent
    multiport serial adapters.  These come in two basic flavors:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Cyclades-8Zo - 8 port board with an octopus cable.
    <li>Cyclades-Ze - expandable model.  HD-50 SCSI cable connects board to
    expansion boxes, each with 16 RJ45 serial ports.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The Cyclades-Z is based on an MIPS R3000 which runs firmware provided by
    the driver.  The firmware handles all flow control, etc.  It also has
    optimizations for PPP (though the driver doesn't implement that yet).  The
    driver defaults to running in polled mode, polling the board every 20ms
    for input.  This is apparently the preferred method of running these
    boards, which is fine, since the board has a very large (4Kbyte) input
    buffer for each channel.
    <p>
    Bill Studenmund and Jason Thorpe wrote the driver.  The development
    was sponsored by <a href="http://www.zembu.com/">Zembu Labs, Inc.</a>

<DATE>pseudo_doc 17 May 2000 - Writing a pseudo device documented
    The NetBSD web pages now have a document detailing how to
    <a href="../Documentation/kernel/pseudo/">write a pseudo-device driver</a>.
    This document includes sample code for a pseudo-device driver
    that can be used as a framework on which to base a working driver.
    The sample code is functional in that it can be incorporated into the
    NetBSD kernel source by following the documented steps and booting the
    resulting kernel to test the sample pseudo-device.  This document
    covers only the i386 architecture.  If anyone has any comments then
    please mail <a href="mailto:blymn@NetBSD.org">Brett Lymn</a>.

<DATE>agc0005 17 May 2000 - Changes to the NetBSD Packages Collection in April 2000

<DATE>bktr_imp 11 May 2000 - Driver for video capture and TV tuner cards (Brooktree 848 based)
    NetBSD-current now includes the bktr driver, supporting
    video capture (frame grabber) and TV tuner cards based on the
    Brooktree Bt848, Bt848A, Bt849A, Bt878 and Bt879 chips.<p>

    Supported hardware includes most cards by AVerMedia, Hauppauge,
    Leadtek, Miro, Pinnacle, Pixelview, and Terratec.  Other hardware may
    also be supported, particularly if it is based on the Brooktree
    Bt848, Bt848A, Bt849A, Bt878, or Bt879. <em>(ATI All-in-Wonder cards
    are a notable exception.)</em><p>
                                                                               
    The <a
    href="ftp://telepresence.dmem.strath.ac.uk/pub/bt848/driver/">bktr
    driver</a> was originally written by Amancio Hasty for FreeBSD and
    is now maintained by Roger Hardiman. Bernd Ernesti, Berndt Josef Wulf,
    Matthias Scheler, and Thomas Klausner ported the driver to NetBSD.
    The driver supports device access through bus_space, and can thus be
    used on all PCI-platforms, such as i386, alpha, cobalt, bebox, and macppc,
    though at the moment it has only been tested on i386.<p>

    series and its successors).

<DATE>viaenv 08 May 2000 - Driver for VIA VT82C686A hardware monitoring
    Johan Danielsson has committed a driver, viaenv(4), for the
    hardware monitoring device of the VIA VT82C686A southbridge chip found
    on some motherboards.

<DATE>saipopts 07 May 2000 - Security Advisory for IP Options Remote DoS
    <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2000-002.txt.asc">
    NetBSD-SA2000-002</a> has been released, and deals with several
    problems in the processing of IP options. Vulnerable systems can
    be crashed remotely by malformed IP packets.  The vulnerability
    applies to NetBSD releases 1.4.2 and earlier, as well as to
    NetBSD-current prior to 2000-05-06, on all architectures.

<DATE>ipf3.4.1 05 May 2000 - New IP Filter version
    IP Filter 3.4.1 is now in NetBSD-current.  Remember to install a new kernel
    before you update the programs.  If you have any problems please send a
    bug report using send-pr(1).

<DATE>sendmail8.10.1 03 May 2000 - NetBSD-current now using sendmail 8.10.1
    <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">sendmail</a> 8.10.1 has been imported
    into the NetBSD-current source code tree.  The upgrade included a 
    configuration file pathname change, from <tt>/etc/sendmail.*</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/mail/sendmail.*</tt>.  Take caution when you upgrade your
    mail servers.

<DATE>ntp4 03 May 2000 - NetBSD-current now using ntp4
    Simon Burge has cut everything over to use ntp4; all traces of xntp3
    should now be gone from the build tree.  Your old ntp.conf configuration
    file should still work. However, there are new features (such as multicast
    support) that you may want to investigate.  There are some 
    rough-around-the-edges man pages supplied, and the full HTML
    documentation supplied with ntp4 is installed in /usr/share/doc/html/ntp.
    For more details please see Simon's message in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2000/05/03/0000.html">current-users
    mail archive</a>.

<DATE>newdevelopers0503 03 May 2000 - New developers
    The NetBSD project is pleased to welcome three new developers:  
    <ul>
    <li>Nick Hudson <skrll@NetBSD.org>, who will be working on pkgsrc.
    <li>Ben Harris <bjh21@NetBSD.org>, who will be integrating his arm26 work.
    <li>Thomas Klausner <wiz@NetBSD.org>, who will be working on pkgsrc and
    getopt_long.
    </ul>

<DATE>mca-snapshot 02 May 2000 - Experimental MCA support snapshot available
    This snapshot, made by Jaromir Dolecek, is a patchset to bring Micro
    Channel Architecture support into NetBSD-current.  It's based upon Scott
    Telford's and McGarry's MCA code.
    <p>
    Almost no devices are supported in the snapshot - the only provided drivers
    (besides ISA lpt, com, vga and floppy) are for IBM Tropic Token-Ring
    adapters and AHA-1650.  Most notably, an ESDI driver is not present at the
    moment.
    <p>
    The download locations are (floppy subdirectory contains a boot floppy with
    an older kernel):
    <blockquote>
    <a href="http://www.ics.muni.cz/~dolecek/NetBSD/MCA/">http://www.ics.muni.cz/~dolecek/NetBSD/MCA/</a><br>
    <a href="http://www.ics.muni.cz/~dolecek/NetBSD/MCA/floppy/">http://www.ics.muni.cz/~dolecek/NetBSD/MCA/floppy/</a><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    It's possible to replace the kernel on the provided floppy image with a
    newer one (kernel configuration file is attached to the patchset).  See
    the README and dev/mca/TODO for drawbacks and current limitations.

<DATE>pre-zero-pages 24 Apr 2000 - Support for zero'ing pages in idle loop
    Jason R Thorpe has just committed code that implements pre-zero'ing of
    pages in the idle loop.  This helps zero-fill page faults a fair bit,
    and also speeds up e.g. page table allocation.  Further details can be

<DATE>arm26 16 Apr 2000 - NetBSD/arm26 experimental snapshot
    A new experimental NetBSD/arm26 snapshot is available.  The snapshot
    consists of a kernel and bootloader for NetBSD/arm26 as of 2000-04-15.
    They are by no means fully functional, but the system gets up as far as
    running user processes.  Notable changes from the last version are:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>root on et (Ether1) devices now works
    <li>rasops1 and rasops2 are compiled in, but don't work properly (boot in
        mode 0 and see!)
    <li>There's detection (but not use) of IOEBs and Unix Backplanes
    <li>pre-emptive multi-tasking works, and init tests it
    </ul>
    <p>
    If you want to test this, further instructions are available at the
    download locations:

<DATE>com_cardbus 16 Apr 2000 - Driver for serial devices on cardbus cards 
    Johan Danielsson has committed a driver for serial devices on cardbus
    cards.  If you have a card that might work with this (the most common case
    would be an ethernet + modem cardbus card), please try it out.

<DATE>umass 04 Apr 2000 - New USB mass storage driver
    Lennart Augustsson has ported a new umass(4) driver from FreeBSD.
    It is more stable and now supports ATAPI devices as well as SCSI devices.

<DATE>auvia 02 Apr 2000 - Driver for VIA VT82C686A integrated audio
    Ty Sarna has committed a driver, auvia(4), for the integrated
    audio of the VIA VT82C686A southbridge chip found on some motherboards. 

<DATE>handspring_visor 31 Mar 2000 - USB driver for Handspring Visor
    Lennart Augustsson has committed a USB driver to NetBSD-current for the
    <a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/vindex.asp">Handspring
    Visor</a>.  It needs testing, so any feedback is appreciated.  More details
    are available in uvisor(4).

<DATE>port-cobalt 31 Mar 2000 - Cobalt Networks Qube and RaQ port added
    A port for the Cobalt Networks Qube and RaQ Microservers has been added.
    See the <a href="../Ports/cobalt/">port-cobalt page</a> for further information.
<DATE>isoc_mode_for_ohci 29 Mar 2000 - Support for USB isochronous mode for OHCI
    Lennart Augustsson has added support for isoc mode on OHCI USB controllers.
    This means that the uaudio driver should work on these now.

<DATE>new_callout_code 23 Mar 2000 - New callout code committed
    Jason Thorpe has committed new callout code to the NetBSD kernel.  The new
    API, described in callout(9), completely replaces the old
    timeout()/untimeout() API.  The new subsystem has two major improvements: 
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Clients provide storage for the callout data structures, thus
    eliminating problems due to resource shortages.
    <li>Insertion and removal of a callout is constant time.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The changes to convert code to the new API were basically mechanical and
    no problems are expected.  If you do encounter any problems please send a
    bug report with send-pr(1) immediately.

<DATE>onoe_awi 22 Mar 2000 - Support for 802.11 DS cards in awi driver
    Atsushi Onoe has updated the awi driver, which now supports 802.11 DS
    cards in addition to 802.11 FH cards.  The cards tested thus far are:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>802.11 FH 1Mbps
	<ul>
	<li>BayStack 650
	<li>Netwave AirSurfer Plus
	</ul>
    <li>802.11 DS 2Mbps
	<ul>
	<li>BayStack 660
	<li>Icom SL-200
	<li>Melco WLI-PCM
	<li>NEL SSMagic
	<li>Netwave AirSurfer Pro
	</ul>
    </ul>

<DATE>cac_support 21 Mar 2000 - Compaq array controller support
    Andrew Doran has recently committed a driver for Compaq array controllers to
    NetBSD-current. cac(4) handles the controller and ca(4)
    handles the arrays. If you have the hardware and would like to try this
    driver out, there are a couple things you should know:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>This driver has only been tested out with a Smart Array 221, but should
    also work on the following boards: SMART-2/E, SMART-2/P, SMART-2SL, Smart
    Array 3100, Smart Array 3100ES, Integrated Array, Smart Array 4200, and
    Smart Array 4200ES.
    <li>It isn't enabled on anything other than i386.  This is temporary.
    <li>It doesn't support anything other than PCI boards right now.  If the
    hardware is out there and there's sufficient interest, Andrew will probably
    work on it.
    <li>If anybody has the kit and could try this driver sooner rather than
    later, it would be appreciated. Access to this hardware is lost to the
    developer near the end of March.
    </ul>
    <p>
    Until there's a snapshot supporting this hardware, you'll find install
    floppy images and a GENERIC kernel at <a

<DATE>netbsd_1.4.2 21 Mar 2000 - NetBSD 1.4.2 Released
    The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.4.2.
    <p>
    This release fixes problems found in the earlier 1.4.x family of
    releases, including some security issues.  We urge users to upgrade
    their systems.  NetBSD 1.4.2 includes important changes on many
    architectures.
    <p>
    The release binaries and source are available now, and can be found on
    mirror sites across the world. Please use a mirror close to you.  A
    gzipped patch is available, containing all of the changes to the main
    system sources since 1.4.1 (just 'src'; not including X or package
    source changes).
    <p>
    NetBSD 1.4.2 contains a number of new features, which have been
    imported from the main NetBSD development branch since NetBSD 1.4.1
    was released, including:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>IPfilter upgrade to version 3.3.6
    <li>XFree upgrade to XFree86 version  3.3.6
    <li>update of BIND to 8.2.2-P5
    <li>driver added for Alteon Gigabit Ethernet cards
    <li>driver added for Realtek 100Mbit/s Ethernet cards
    <li>driver added for VIA Rhine Fast PCI Ethernet cards
    <li>driver added for DPT SmartCache/SmartRAID III or IV SCSI adapters
    <li>driver added for BOCA 6-port ISA serial cards
    <li>support for X-surf board on Amiga
    <li>support for ext2fs revision 1 (with read-only support for
    'sparse_super' and 'filetype' options)
    <li>SysV compatible user management utilities (useradd, ...)
    <li>mktemp(1) added (primarily for use in shell scripts)
    <li>tcpdump now can do hex/ascii dumps
    <li>errno is now always a macro, to ease the integration of thread
    libraries with both system and third-party libraries
    </ul>
    <p>
    Additionally, more than 120 formally reported problems have been fixed
    since NetBSD 1.4.1, and NetBSD 1.4.2 also contains fixes for a lot of
    non-reported problems discovered by developers and others during the
    NetBSD 1.4.2 release cycle.
    <p>
    A full list of all the changes applied between NetBSD 1.4.1 and NetBSD
    1.4.2 can be found in

<DATE>iopener_booted_with_netbsd 19 Mar 2000 - Netpliance i-opener booted with NetBSD
    Andrew Gillham has booted NetBSD/i386 -current on his Netpliance i-opener.
    He did this without opening the case and without using a 2.5" IDE hard
    drive.  The steps involved (using a normal keyboard) are:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Get to a root shell, via 'ESC 4' and fast typing.
    <li>Bring up PPP to a NetBSD machine.  Having a PBX helps.
    <li>Backup the 16MB of flash, with the following:
	<dl><dd># cat /dev/hd0 | gzip -9 &gt; hd0.gz</dd></dl>
	<dl><dd># ftp &lt;your server&gt;</dd></dl>
	<dl><dd>ftp&gt; put hd0.gz</dd></dl>
    <li>Replace flash with NetBSD image, by ftping compressed file.
	<dl><dd># gzip -d -c file_name.gz | cat &gt; /dev/hd0</dd></dl>
    <li>Wait a few seconds, yank the power to prevent QNX updating flash.
    <li>Reboot under NetBSD, enjoy.
    </ol>

<DATE>new_ahc_driver 17 Mar 2000 - New ahc driver
    Frank van der Linden has checked in a new version of the ahc driver
    (Adaptec SCSI), based on the FreeBSD driver by Justin Gibbs.
    <p>
    This driver provides support for the newer Adaptec cards, most notably
    789x-based ones.  The option that the old driver had to enable tagged
    queueing (AHC_TAGENABLE) is not there yet.  This option has not been
    enabled yet to avoid possible problems it might add.  At this point,
    without it, the driver should be quite stable.

    too many things to even try to mention here.  Jason joins Ross
    Harvey as co-portmaster of the NetBSD/alpha.

<DATE>rss 02 Mar 2000 - NetBSD News Channels
    Two new channels have been created using Rich Site Summary files, an XML
    dialect, to provide NetBSD related News to content providers and their
    users. The files are parsed by news services today to retrieve
    information, and re-distribute it in their reader forums and/or sent out
    via mail directly to your cell phone, if you decide so. Both general
    NetBSD News and News related to the NetBSD Packages Collection are now
    available not only from the NetBSD web site, but also from the sites
    listed on the <a href="rss.html">RSS-page</a>.

<DATE>i386smp2 29 Feb 2000 - New test kernels for SMP on i386
    Bill Sommerfeld has put up a second round of test kernels for SMP on i386.
    See Bill's announcement in the <a

    mail archive</a> for a list of changes since the first round and more
    details.

<DATE>raid_autoconfig 29 Feb 2000 - New kernel option regarding RAIDframe
    Greg Oster has added a new kernel option, RAID_AUTOCONFIG, to
    NetBSD-current. Adding:
    <blockquote>
    options RAID_AUTOCONFIG
    </blockquote>
    to your kernel config will enable the auto-detection of RAID components
    and auto-configuration of RAID sets.  More information is available in the
    recently updated raid(4) and raidctl(8) manpages.

<DATE>softdepchanges 25 Feb 2000 - Improvements to Soft Updates
    Ethan Solomita has fixed several known bugs regarding Soft Updates,
    including:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Out of memory panic in kmem_map
        <li>Fix to "<a
        href="../Documentation/kernel/#spl_not_lowered">SPL
        NOT LOWERED ON SYSCALL EXIT</a>" kernel message
        <li>Livelock with lots of disk activity, but no forward progress
        <li>Panic from link count being changed
    </ul>
    <p>
    among several others.  It should be a much more stable filesystem now and
    the performance improvements can be tremendous.  <b>Update:</b> Information
    on how to enable softdeps is located in the <a
    href="../Documentation/misc/#softdeps">How to use soft
    updates</a> FAQ entry.

<DATE>saptraceprocfs 16 Feb 2000 - Security Advisories for ptrace(2) and procfs
    Two new Security Advisories have been released:
    <p>
    <ul>
	<li><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA1999-012.txt.asc">
	NetBSD-SA1999-012</a> deals with a vulnerability in the ptrace(2) system call, 
	and is applicable to the <a href="../Ports/vax/">NetBSD/vax</a> platform
 	<b>only</b>.
	<li><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2000-001.txt.asc">
	NetBSD-SA2000-001</a> deals with a vulnerability in the procfs filesystem.<br>
	<B>UPDATED:</B> This SA has been updated to include new
	information; the problem is applicable to a wider range of
	systems than described in the original version.
    </ul>
    <p> Both of these vulnerabilities apply to NetBSD releases 1.4.1 and earlier, 
    as well as to NetBSD-current prior to the dates listed in the
    advisories.  The fixes have been incorporated into the upcoming
    NetBSD 1.4.2 release.
    <p> More information on previous <a href="../Security/advisory.html">security 
    advisories</a> is available in the NetBSD <a href="../Security/">
    security</a> pages.

<DATE>raidframechanges 14 Feb 2000 - Large number of changes to RAIDframe code
    Greg Oster has checked in a multitude of changes to the RAIDframe code.
    What follows is a summary of what's new and exciting:
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>The size (and content) of the component labels have changed.
        You'll want to make sure you're using 'raidctl' from the same date as
        the kernel.
        <li>/sbin/disklabel supports a 'RAID' partition type, which indicates
        that the partition is a component of a RAID set.  Partitions of the
        type RAID are not required at this time -- the old 4.2BSD partition
        type (with fsize, bsize, and cpg ignored) still works fine.  The RAID
        type is needed for 3) however.
        <li>A "first cut" at RAID autoconfiguration code has been committed but
        is disabled by default.  When enabled, partitions of type RAID are
        automagically detected at boot time, and assuming there are enough
        components and enough set information, the corresponding RAID set is
        automatically configured before / is available (this is critical for 4).
        <li>A "first cut" at 'root' on a RAID partition has been checked in.
        This still requires a lot of testing, but it does work.  At the moment
        it looks like we may be stuck getting a kernel from some other place
        (e.g. a separate, non-RAID partition).
    </ol>
    <p>

        <li>Todd Whitesel, who will be working on snapshots.
    </ul> 

<DATE>pcmciairq 10 Feb 2000 - Recent pcmcia irq changes
    Christian E. Hopps has committed code to NetBSD-current that probes to
    discover the irq lines wired and usable by the pcic device.
    <p>
    The code should support everything except the Cirrus chipset.  The Cirrus
    chips do not implement the full i82365 register set, leaving out the
    ability to cause soft-interrupts (i.e., poke them and they interrupt).  This
    ability is a pc97 requirement that Cirrus doesn't support.
    <p>
    If you have a chipset other than Cirrus you should be able to remove
    <blockquote>
    options PCIC_ISA_INTR_ALLOC_MASK=&lt;somemask&gt;
    </blockquote>
    from your kernel config and have everything found correctly.  If you're
    going to do this please read Christian's message in its entirety at the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/current-users/2000/02/01/0009.html">current-users

<DATE>netbsd-firewall 09 Feb 2000 - The NetBSD/i386 firewall project
    The <a href="http://www.dubbele.com/">NetBSD/i386 Firewall</a>
    projects aims to provide a free firewall solution for people
    with a permanent Internet connection. This includes most users
    of cable or ADSL services, but also businesses with leased
    lines.

<DATE>pso-tcpip	09 Feb 2000 - PSO Systems' TCP/IP Stack for VxWorks
    PSO systems ported the NetBSD TCP/IP networking stack to VxWorks,
    to produce their <a href="http://www.pso.com/psoproduct.html">PSO
    Stack</a> product. They selected NetBSD since the networking
    is more mature than that of Linux, and the licences are better
    for embedded work.

<DATE>wiencryption 09 Feb 2000 - IEEE WaveLan driver gets encryption support
    WEP encryption bits have been added to the wi driver.  The way to set keys,
    enable encryption, etc is:
        <dl><dd>
        wiconfig -i wi0 -k 0x0123456789012345678901234567 -v 1<br>
        wiconfig -i wi0 -T 1<br>
        wiconfig -i wi0 -e 1<br>
        </dd></dl>
    That will set the key (key #1, to be exact), set the transmit key to #1,
    and enable encryption.

<DATE>aviatorraylink 09 Feb 2000 - Driver for Aviator 2.4 / PRO and Raylink 802.11 FH
    Christian E. Hopps has written a driver for NetBSD-current which adds
    support for the WebGear Aviator 2.4 / Pro and Raytheon Raylink 802.11 FH.
    Also, support has been added to ifconfig to configure the network ID and
    set adhoc/infrastructure mode through media options.

    There is also an automated list of pkgsrc changes, generated daily from
    <CURRENTSRC>pkgsrc/doc/CHANGES, available on the <a
    href="pkg-changes.html">Recent packages changes</a> page.

<DATE>usacryptolaws 04 Feb 2000 - How the change in USA crypto export laws affects NetBSD
    The core team's consensus decision on how NetBSD should react in light of
    the apparently changed crypto laws is as follows:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ensure that the said laws are in effect, and that NetBSD is permitted
    to export crypto and have USA developers work on foreign crypto.
    <li>Ensure that the appropriate paperwork is submitted to fulfill any
    requirements to permit the above to occur.
    <li>Merge any salient code from crypto-us into crypto-intl, and maintain
    one code base for crypto in a repository which is off-shore from the USA.
    <li>Deprecate crypto-us
    </ul>
    <p>
    The rationale behind deprecating crypto-us would be due to the fact that
    USA developers would be allowed to work on foreign crypto source and
    re-export foreign crypto in source and binary.  Also, in the worst case
    scenario, if the USA government changes its stance to be less helpful,
    NetBSD would be better off.
    <p>
    This position is based on none of the above if it results in behaviour
    which is contrary to the new laws.

<DATE>lukemftp12 03 Feb 2000 - Luke Mewburn has released lukemftp 1.2
    A new release of lukemftp, a port of the enhanced NetBSD ftp client to
    other systems, is now available.  lukemftp uses an autoconf configure
    script and replacement library for systems which don't have NetBSD-specific
    library functions.  This version fixes bugs, adds new features, and
    further improves portability.  The main ftp site for lukemftp is <a

<DATE>specialolympics2000 28 Jan 2000 - Canadian Special Olympics 2000 Winter Games
    The <a href="http://www.specialolympics2000.ca/">Canadian Special
    Olympics 2000 Winter Games</a> are using several NetBSD servers
    to provide connectivity, file storage, and backup.  At the main
    office, a NetBSD server has been providing shared and secure
    Internet dial service for up to 20 machines, as well as file
    storage and automated off-site backups from June 1999.  As the
    Games approached, several other NetBSD servers were set up on
    lan's at the various event venues to provide Internet service
    for event officials, the media, and the athletes.  These servers
    allow officials to post results to the web site immediately
    after the results are finalized, media to communicate stories
    and results to their offices, and athletes to send email back
    home and check out the results.
    <p>
    The CSO 2000 Winter Games run from January 25th to January
    29th, 2000 in Ottawa, Ontario.

<DATE>usb-ethernet 18 Jan 2000 - Support for USB Ethernet adapters

<DATE>ftpd 10 Jan 2000 - Recent ftpd enhancements
    Luke Mewburn has been improving ftpd recently. Here's a list of
    some of the enhancements (over the ftpd in NetBSD 1.4):
    <ul>
    <li>Connection limits
    <li>ftpusers(5): support allocation into specific classes based
	      on username, group membership, or remote hostname/address
	      (with globbing in each)
    <li>Display (and log) transfer stats for each connection
    <li>Configurable motd file
    <li>Transfer rate limit/throttle
    <li>Disabling of uploads
    <li>Support for `%' escapes in files displayed to the user
    <li>Manage utmp(5) entries
    <li>Class templates, to simplify ftpd.conf rules
    <li>Define hostname to return to client (makes setting a virtual
	      ftp server trivial, when used in conjunction with inetd(8)'s
	      ability to bind a service to a given ip address).
    </ul>
    More information is available in -current in ftpd(8), ftpd.conf(5),
    ftpusers(5), and in the example config files in
    <CURRENTSRC>/usr/share/examples/ftpd/.
    <b>Note: the links above will be to the 1.4 manpages.</b>

<DATE>rsaref2 14 Dec 1999 - RSAREF2 library buffer overruns fixed
Recently, there have been several buffer overruns discovered in
the RSAREF library.  Shortly after the bugtraq post reporting this
problem was released, the fix supplied in that post was added to
pkgsrc.
<p>
However, as the CERT advisory CA-99-15 states:
<blockquote>
   We believe the patch originally provided by Core SDI in their
   advisory may not be a complete fix to this particular problem.
</blockquote>
Correspondingly, the revised fix referenced by the advisory has
been applied to NetBSD's pkgsrc distribution and is present in
<PKGSRC>security/rsaref version 2.0p3 and later. NetBSD users who
use packages depending on rsaref should fetch the most recent pkgsrc
bits as soon as practical and rebuild packages, including
<PKGSRC>security/ssh, which depend on rsaref.
<p>
If '<b><tt>pkg_info rsaref</tt></b>' returns no output,
'<tt>rsaref-2.0p3</tt>', or later, then you do not have the affected
pkgsrc version installed. If you do have the affected version,
'<b><tt>pkg_info -R rsaref</tt></b>' will list potentially impacted
packages that should be reinstalled.

<DATE>mailsearch 14 Dec 1999 - Searchable mailing lists back up!

<DATE>raidframe+softdep 12 Dec 1999 - RAIDframe with softdeps
We are happy to announce that with a little bit of rototilling in
the RAIDframe code, RAIDframe and softdeps now play very nicely
together.  The IO throttling code in RAIDframe has been given a
good overhaul, with the result being that RAID IO is once again
very stable (the old code had some problems under very high load)
and that the softdeps code can now be used with RAID-based partitions.

<DATE>news68k 12 Dec 1999 - NetBSD/news68k port committed

<DATE>softupdate 15 Nov 1999 - Soft update code integrated into the main tree
Frank van der Linden (<A HREF="mailto:frank@wins.uva.nl">frank@wins.uva.nl</A>)
has brought Kirk McKusick's trickle sync + FFS soft update code into
the main tree. It has had some moderate to heavy testing over the
last month.  He's currently using it on his /usr filesystem and the
filesystem containing all his sources on his main NetBSD development
machine, and did not have a problem since fixing the last known
bug (2.5 weeks ago).

<p>
To use it, do the following:

<ol>
<li>Update your sources.
<li>Compile a new kernel with "options SOFTDEP" in your kernel config file.
<li>Run the new kernel.
<li>Install the new include files from sys/sys (i.e. at least do
   cd /usr/src/sys ; make includes). To be safe, just install them all
   (cd /usr/src ; make includes)
<li>At least recompile libc, sbin/mount, sbin/fsck_ffs, sbin/tunefs, and
   install them.
<li>Run "tunefs -n enable /dev/rXd0x" to enable soft updates on the
   filesystem(s) of your choice.
<li>Remove "update=YES" from your /etc/rc.conf file. update(8) is no longer
   needed. Its work is now done in a more sophisticated way by a kernel
   thread.
<li>Reboot
<li>Have fun testing.
</ol>

<p>
If you have any problems, please send PRs, or mail Frank, with as much
detail as you can gather.

<DATE>comdex-fall-1999 15 Nov 1999 - NetBSD booth at Comdex
The NetBSD Project is hosting a booth at
<a href="http://www.zdevents.com/comdex/">Comdex Fall 1999</a>. See the world's
most portable operating system running on several hardware platforms, including

<DATE>pnp-bios 14 Nov 1999 - Plug-and-Play BIOS support
There is now code in NetBSD-current to make use of the Plug-and-Play
BIOS present in practically all PC compatibles manufactured in the
last couple of years.
<p>
The PnP BIOS provides device types and resource usage for hardware
on the mainboard.  (For reference, see <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/respec/pnpspecs.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/respec/pnpspecs.htm</a>)
This allows ISA devices with unusual wiring to be accessed properly,
and (potentially harmful) device probing can be avoided.  The PnP
BIOS support has been found most useful on laptops, where it seems
common that interrupts are wired in strange ways. It shouldn't do
any harm on other machines -- you know there is that other operating
system which depends heavily on Plug-and-Pray. 
<p>
It is young code however, the PnP BIOSes are of varying quality,
and the specification is not clear in all details (and only partly
obeyed by BIOS vendors). So keep a working kernel around if you
play with this...
<p>
The NetBSD PnP BIOS support is implemented as a logical bus
named "pnpbios", it will be enabled by a line:
<pre>	pnpbios0 at mainbus0</pre>
in the kernel configuration file. For now, only a few device
attachments are implemented - see the comments in 
<CURRENTSRC>/sys/arch/i386/conf/GENERIC
or the contents of 
<CURRENTSRC>/sys/arch/i386/pnpbios/
for details. The kernel option
<pre>	options PNPBIOSVERBOSE</pre>
causes all devices nodes to be reported in the boot log, and their
resource usage. To interpret the PnP IDs,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/download/respec/devids.txt">
http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/download/respec/devids.txt</a> might be
of some help.  Have a look at devices with unusual resource usage
- these might be worth writing some attachment code.
<p>
As usual, please report any problems you find.

<a href="http://cvsweb.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/">cvsweb</a>
service. They have also been added to the <PKGSRC>net/rsync
service at <a href="rsync://rsync.jp.NetBSD.org/anoncvs/main/">rsync.jp.NetBSD.org</a>.

<DATE>softdeps 19 Oct 1999 - FFS soft dependencies code available
Kirk McKusick's FFS soft updates/dependency code has been around for quite
a bit, and has been in an "almost ready" state for NetBSD for close
to 2 years now. Which is a big shame, we really need to get this
integrated.
<p>
So,  Frank van der Linden has put it on a branch in our CVS tree, for the
adventurous to use and debug.
<p>
Simple usage:
<ol>
<li>Get the code. For example, using anoncvs and ssh, set CVS_RSH to
'ssh', and do:
<blockquote>
cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot co -r fvdl-softdep src-nocrypto
</blockquote>
This will create a directory called "src" with all that you need
in it. This includes all of src/sys, and a few bits living in
sbin/. Frank did not tag the rest of the sources, so they will not
be checked out; they are not needed for testing (you can just
use the rest of -current for that).
<p>
If you want a complete tree, checking out the whole
"src-nocrypto" without "-r fvdl-softdep", and then
doing a cvs update using the -r flag of that tree
should work.
<li>Compile a kernel as you always would, in the checked out tree.
<li>Compile the userland utilities (fsck_ffs, tunefs, mount)
Note that these will grab the wrong &lt;sys/foo.h&gt; include
files if you compile them, it's easiest to add a line
<blockquote>
CPPFLAGS+=-I../../sys
</blockquote>
...to the Makefiles.
<li>You can remove "update" from /etc/rc.conf if you want
to do some more permanent testing, since it's no longer
needed with the "trickle sync" code that comes with
the softdep code.
<li>Boot the new kernel.
<li>Find a crash & burn filesystem. Run the new tunefs binary on it as:
<blockquote>
tunefs -n enable /dev/rXdXX
</blockquote>
<li>Mess around with the filesystem.
</ol>

<p>
Note that there is a known bug currently, which makes unmounting filesystems
with soft dependencies, that have been used moderately, hang.
<p>
Frank advises against using this yet if you're not willing to deal with
hanging unmounts and possible other problems. However, he would really
appreciate it if people could test it. Even if it's just a new kernel
without any filesystems that use soft dependencies (this should be
a lot more stable).


<DATE>cardbus 17 Oct 1999 - Cardbus code integrated
Hayakawa Koichi has integrated his <a href="../Hardware/cardbus.html">Cardbus code into -current</a>.

<DATE>isdn4bsd-0.83 30 Jul 1999 - isdn4bsd 0.83 beta released
    A new isdn4bsd beta version (i4b-00.83.00-beta-300799.tar.gz) has been
    made available on the <a href="ftp://i4b.consol.de/pub">isdn4bsd
    distribution site</a>.<p>

    Isdn4bsd (or in short i4b) is a package for interfacing a
    computer running FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD or BSD/OS to the
    ISDN. Supported NetBSD architectures are NetBSD/Alpha,
    NetBSD/Amiga, NetBSD/Atari and NetBSD/i386.<p>

    The only ISDN protocol currently supported is the BRI protocol
    specified in I.430, Q.921 and Q.931; better known as DSS1 or
    Euro-ISDN.<p>

    Isdn4bsd allows you to make IP network connections by using
    either IP packets sent in raw HDLC frames on the B channel or
    by using built-in synchronous PPP.<p>

    For telephony, isdn4bsd can answer incoming phone calls like
    an answering machine and now has preliminary dialout capabilities
    for voice and data calls.<p>

    Bugfixes, enhancements, erratas and addons (if any) will be made
    available at <a href="http://www.freebsd-support.de/i4b/">this site</a>.

<DATE>ip6 1 Jul 1999 - Integration of IPv6 support from KAME
    NetBSD now supports the emerging standard for IP version 6, AKA
    IPng.  Code for this was imported from the <a
    href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME Project</a>.  To enable IPv6,
    compile a kernel from the GENERIC.v6 config file, or include
    "options INET6" for the bare minimum IPv6 support.  For a listing
    of new programs available with this code integration, see the KAME
    web site.

<DATE>ev6 29 Jun 1999 - New generation of EV6 systems now supported by NetBSD/alpha
    NetBSD/alpha now supports the new generation of systems based on
    the 21264 CPU.  Supported systems now include the 264DP, XP1000,
    DS20, and others.  This work was supported by
    <a href="http://www.alpha-processor.com/">Alpha Processor, Inc</a>.

<DATE>netbsd-release 28 Jun 1999 - NetBSD release branch available via FTP and SUP.
    We are glad to announce that the NetBSD project now offers a daily
    updated snapshot of the current NetBSD release sources.  This is
    currently the `netbsd-1-4' branch.
    <p>
    The directory <a
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release/">ftp.NetBSD.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-release</a>
    contains the extracted sources plus weekly updated tar files.
    these files are created in a similar manner to those in the <a
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org:/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current</a>
    directory.
    <p>
    A new sup collection called `release' has been created.  inside
    this new collection are the same SUP releases you can find in the
    `current' collection, excluding the `doc', `pkgsrc' and `xsrc' SUP
    releases, as these source have not in the past been branched for a
    NetBSD release.
    <p>
    The <CURRENTSRC>src/doc/README.sup
    file has been updated accordingly.
    <p>
    Please report any problems you see with the FTP or SUP server.
    (note that for a short time after the normal overnight update the
    SUP server was using the `release' files for the `current'
    collection, but this has been rectified).

<DATE>cvschanges 23 Jun 1999 - CVS changes in HTML format
    The last nine months of CVS change mail-archives are now
    automatically indexed by month and module/tag and processed
    into a set of <a href="cvschanges/">html</a> pages.

<DATE>new-sun3-portmaster 23 Jun 1999 - New sun3 portmaster
    Nathan Williams takes over from Gordon Ross, who was the <a
    href="../Ports/sun3/">sun3</a> port maintainer for
    several years. We would like to thank Gordon for all the work he
    has contributed to the project through his very long and productive
    tenure.
    <p>
    Jeremy Cooper will remain in his current position as maintainer of code
    related to the sun3x architecture.
    <p>
    Let's all welcome the new port maintainer and wish him good luck, and a
    lot of patience! :-)

<DATE>usenix-99 6 Jun 1999 - Usenix '99
    There is a <a href="../gallery/reports/usenix-1999.html">full report</a>
    of the NetBSD feedback received during the 1999 USENIX Annual Technical
    Conference.

<DATE>sa1999-010 21 May 1999 - 1.3* ARP table DOS Security Advisory
The implementation of ARP packet reception in NetBSD 1.3* is vulnerable
two attacks:
<p>
<ol>
<li>On multihomed hosts, ARP packets from cable A can overwrite ARP
    entries for cable B.
<li>For all hosts, ARP packets can overwrite ARP entries marked as static.
</ol>
<p>
For more details, please see the <a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA1999-010.txt.asc">security
advisory</a>.

<DATE>user-groups-listing 21 May 1999 - User groups listing added
We've only just started compiling <a href="../gallery/groups.html">this
list</a>, so bear with us. The intention is to make this a valuable
resource for any NetBSD user looking for other local NetBSD people.

<DATE>hypersparc-support 20 May 1999 - Hypersparc support in NetBSD/sparc
Paul Kranenburg has made some changes today that should allow
Hypersparc machines to operate correctly in -current <a
href="../Ports/sparc/">NetBSD/sparc</a>.
<p>
Hypersparcs have a VIPT cache, which means that to flush a page from
the cache a virtual-to-physical translation is done to do the cache tag
comparison.  This will cause an entry to appear in the MMU's TLB.  So,
when removing or changing mappings, doing a cache flush after clearing
entries from the TLB may cause spurious TLB entries causing funny
effects in your programs.  Some pmap functions had the cache and TLB
flush operation in the wrong order.
<p>
He is looking into providing the necessary patches to enable hypersparc
support in NetBSD 1.4.1.

<DATE>allocsys 20 May 1999 - MI allocsys() and BUFCACHE on all ports
Luke Mewburn has made `allocsys()' machine independent. Additional
benefits include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Printing out system memory sizes consistently uses
a new kernel function - format_bytes() (which uses another new function;
humanize_number()) to display the info.
<li>all ports should now support the <code>BUFCACHE</code> option
(see options(4)).
</ul>

<DATE>kame_snap_199905 17 May 1999 - KAME experimental snapshot supports NetBSD-1.4
KAME is a project doing IPv6 and IPsec work on *BSDs.
From now on, NetBSD-1.4 is supported in the KAME kits.
<p>
Their packages are free of charge but have absolutely no warranty.
Experimental snapshots are available at
ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/snap/, every Monday.  Please visit <a
href="http://www.kame.net/">the KAME web pages</a> for details.

<DATE>netbsd-1.4 12 May 1999 - NetBSD 1.4 released
We are pleased to announce release 1.4 of the NetBSD Operating System,
a complete and fully functional Open Source Unix-like OS.
<p>
NetBSD runs on twenty different system architectures featuring eight
distinct families of CPUs, and is being ported to more.
<p>
For more details please see the <a href="../Releases/formal-1.4/">
formal release page</a>

<DATE>hypercom-parallel 10 May 1999 - HyperCom 3+/4+ parallel port support
The lpt-clone parallel ports on the HyperCom 3+/4+ boards are supported
in NetBSD/Amiga - current.  People using NetBSD/Amiga 1.4 can add
support for this by applying a <code>hypercom-parallel-patch</code> patch
file to their kernel sources, and rebuilding. [<i>This patch has been
merged into the 1.4.1 release.</i>]

<DATE>pool-diagnostic-helpers 10 May 1999 - Pool allocator diagnostic helpers
I've made some changes to the pool allocator which will aid in tracking
down problems with memory allocation...
<p>
I've added a "show pool" command to DDB, which dumps fairly complete
information about a pool.  Two modifiers ara available: /p (show page
headers) and /l (show log).
<p>
Logging is now enabled on a per-pool basis, so if you only need to track
allocations and frees on the mclpool, you can do that by making a change to
the pool_init() call that passes PR_LOGGING.  You can enable logging on all
pools by using the kernel option POOL_DIAGNOSTIC.
<p>
Pool logging now also works on pools that are not pool_create()'d, but
rather just pool_init()'d.  If the pool_init() call is made too early to use
malloc(), logging is disabled automatically.
<p>
I've also changed the ABI somewhat; file and line indicators are now ALWAYS
passed to pool_get(), pool_put(), and pool_reclaim().  These are used to
perform reentrancy checking and logging.  Logging and reentrancy checking are
available if DIAGNOSTIC is defined.  The file and line info are always passed
for the benefit of LKMs, etc.

<DATE>isdn4bsd-00.80 08 May 1999 - isdn4bsd-00.80.00-beta publicly available
<p>
A new isdn4bsd beta version (i4b-00.80.00-beta-070599.tar.gz) has been made
available on the isdn4bsd distribution sites.
<p>
Many bugs - especially some fat ones causing occasional reboots without
panic messages - have been fixed.
<p>
Some enhancements were made and some features were added.
<p>
Support for <a href="../Ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386-1.4</a>,
<a href="../Ports/amiga/">NetBSD/Amiga-1.4</a>, <a
href="../Ports/atari/">NetBSD/Atari-1.4</a> and limited
support for NetBSD/i386-1.3.3 is available.  Drivers for several PCI,
ISA, ISAPNP, PCMCIA and ZBUS boards are included.  Only the European
protocol suite is supported in this test release.
<p>
For more information on isdn4bsd, please read the file README in the isdn4bsd
base directory.
<p>
For NetBSD installation instructions, please read the file INSTALLATION in the
NetBSD directory.
<p>
The ISDN4BSD package is available from <a
href="ftp://isdn4bsd@ftp.consol.de/pub/">isdn4bsd@ftp.consol.de/pub</a>.
You have to log in as user <em>isdn4bsd</em> and give your email
address as the password. Then change to the <code>pub</code>
directory.  Anonymous ftp as user <em>ftp</em> or <em>anonymous</em>
will <em>NOT(!)</em> work!

<DATE>macppc-usb-keyboard 06 May 1999 - macppc USB keyboard works without kludge
I have committed all of the changes necessary for the iMac and new G3
to attach the USB keyboard properly, without the need for a source
modification in a local tree.  It all happens based on what the
OpenFirmware says the console input device is.
<p>
This also fixes ADB keyboard support on the new G3.  ADB keyboard support
should work just fine on older PowerMacs, too, but we're going to test
an 8500 and a 7300 RSN.
<p>
I've asked that these all be pulled into the release branch, so that
1.4 (i.e. the CD being given away at USENIX!) will support these systems.
<p>
I think Charles Hannum is hoping to demo an iMac running NetBSD in the
NetBSD vendor booth at USENIX!  So this was the source of some of the
development push :-)
<p>
Thanks lots to Bill Studenmund for testing the spew of patches that
came flying into his mailbox, and thanks Tsubai for catching some of
the glitches in my Bandit changes :-)
<p>
FWIW, the test system has been a new G3.  PCI IDE works great, and there's
also a BusLogic BT-958 SCSI in it, which also works fine :-)
<p>
Jason R. Thorpe <a href="mailto:thorpej@nas.nasa.gov">thorpej@nas.nasa.gov</a>

<DATE>compat_osf1-enhancements 05 May 1999 - COMPAT_OSF1 enhancements
In post-NetBSD 1.4-branch NetBSD-current, <a
href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a> has much improved
OSF/1 (a.k.a. Digital UNIX, a.k.a. Tru64 UNIX) emulation, including
support for dynamically linked binaries.
<p>
Of note, the following applications are known to work to the extent
that they have been tested:
<p>
<table>
<tr><th align=left>Application and Version</th>
    <th align=left>Digital UNIX Env. Version</th></tr>
<tr><td>Navigator 4.08</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Navigator 4.51</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Navigator 4.51</td><td>4.0E</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/GMVHome.html">
	General Mesh Viewer</a> (decMesa variant)</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
(Java and Javascript even appear to work, in Navigator!)
<p>
I expect that earlier versions of those applications, for earlier
versions of the Digital UNIX (or DEC OSF/1) environment, will function
with little or no effort but (not having them 8-) I couldn't verify
that.
<p>
Once NetBSD-current reverts back to the 'trunk' of the development
sources (after 1.4 is released), this will be available to you all as
part of NetBSD-current.
<p>
If you're not interested in running NetBSD-current, and instead want
to run the upcoming NetBSD 1.4 release, I have prepared a set of
patches to the 1.4 sources which integrate the functionality into
NetBSD 1.4.  If you're interested in getting the patches and are
willing to provide me feedback about what you're testing with them and
how well it works, please send me e-mail.

  After a year of development, the latest release of the NRL IPv6+IPsec
software is now available to the public. As the name suggests, this software is
an implementation of IP Version 6 and IP Security (separately and together).
<p>
  This version supports:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>BSD/OS 4.0 on x86 (supplements our code previously merged into 4.0)
    <li>OpenBSD 2.3 and 2.4 on x86 and sparc (a more integrated version of this
      release is now in OpenBSD's CVS tree; you need userland from this kit)

    <li>FreeBSD 3.0 on x86
    <li>Linux 2.1 on x86 (for PF_KEY only)
</ul>
<p>
  This release adds a lot of ports, updates the code to conform to newer
versions of many specs (which effectively meant rewriting portions of the
code), and includes a lot of general cleanups and improvements.

<DATE>netbsd_sparc64 23 Jan 1999 - NetBSD/sparc64 on Sun UltraSPARC
The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce the availability of a port to
Sun UltraSPARC hardware. <a
href="../Ports/sparc64/">NetBSD/sparc64</a> is the product of
a 2-year volunteer effort by Eduardo Horvath, along with assistance
from the following people (in no particular order):
<ul>
    <li>Matthew Green (32-bit emulation, other miscellaneous help)
    <li>Paul Kranenburg (machine-independent SBUS drivers)
    <li>Chuck Cranor (VM-related issues)
    <li>Chris Demetriou (miscellaneous good suggestions)
    <li>Jason Thorpe (driver interface issues)
</ul>
Currently supported hardware:
<ul>
    <li>UltraSPARC I and II CPUs
    <li>esp SCSI controllers
    <li>le ethernet controllers
    <li>zs serial ports
    <li>cgsix graphics controllers
</ul>
Any of the other drivers from the <a
href="../Ports/sparc/">NetBSD/sparc</a> port might also
work.
<p>
Presently, NetBSD/sparc64 supports certain Ultra platforms with the
devices listed above.  The 32-bit kernel runs most NetBSD/sparc binaries.
A 64-bit version of the system currently exists and runs on some
hardware, but requires further development to be fully functional.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks go to Eduardo for his hard work and perseverance.  We look
forward to continued development of this exciting new port!

<DATE>netbsd_1.3.3 23 Dec 1998 - NetBSD 1.3.3 Released
<p>
The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.3.3.
<p>
This release fixes a substantial number of bugs found in the 1.3.x
family of releases, including security issues.  We urge users on the
Internet to upgrade their systems.
<p>
It includes significant new or updated features, such as an updated
FTP client and updated package tools, and updates our version of the X
Window System from XFree86 release 3.3.2 to XFree86 3.3.3.
<p>
Finally, it also includes a somewhat improved installation procedure
for multiple ports.
<p>
The <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.3/">release
binaries and source</a> are available now, and can be found on <a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.3/MIRRORS">mirror
sites</a> across the world. Please use a mirror close to you.
<p>
A <a

<DATE>new_vax_snapshot 02 Dec 1998 - New VAX snapshot
<ul>
<li>Dynamic linked libraries
<li>EGCS as native C compiler
<li>UVM as new memory management system
<li>Improved support for VS3100's
<li>X client programs precompiled
</ul>
and a bunch of other stuff.
<p>
The install files is in <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/vax/snapshot/19981201/binary/sets/">pub/NetBSD/arch/vax/snapshot/19981201/binary/sets/</a>
on ftp.NetBSD.org. I will also provide a new improved install system
(using sysinst) in the nearest weeks, but it isn't working OK on all
systems yet. This will supersede the old install system with copy and
edlabel; and extract everything from the disk instead.
<p>
Many thanks to Matt Thomas, who wrote the shared libraries and EGCS
support for <a href="../Ports/vax/">NetBSD/VAX</a>.
<p>
The long-time-wanted support for SCSI on VS3100 is also closing up:
Jens A Nilsson got tired of not having this so he wrote PIO
support for it. He will probably in the near future also finish DMA
support, anyway, some SCSI will be in the install kernels when I upload them.
<p>
Note: A complete installation _will_ fit on a RD54 (I tried :-)

simulator and a device driver for a limited number of architectures.
The RAIDframe device driver in NetBSD-current is a full RAID
implementation, including levels 0, 1, 4, 5, hot spares, and more, and
is available for all NetBSD platforms.  The base code for RAID level 6,
parity logging, and a number of other features is present in the
driver, but requires additional testing and debugging.  For more

<DATE>gre 13 Sep 1998 - Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) implementation
<p>
This is a very alpha implementation of GRE packet encapsulation.
Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) is described in RFC 1701 and 1702.
The interface also supports IPIP (protocol 4) encapsulation,
as described in RFC 2003 but default is GRE mode.
</p><p>
Basically GRE allows to tunnel not only IP over IP, but also provides
for other protocols like Appletalk etc. Cisco routers do their multicast
tunnels over GRE (1). The hope is, that with GRE encapsulation, a method
is found to encapsulate all other protocols with one mechanism and reduce
the need for own tunneling in ip_mroute etc.

<DATE>uvm_switch 02 Sep 1998 - bebox, macppc, ofppc, and pc532 switch to UVM
The three powerpc based NetSBD ports, and the pc532 have switched over to
<a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a> virtual
memory system.
<ul>
<li>BeBox (<a href="../Ports/bebox/">bebox</a>).
<li>NS32532 based pc532 (<a href="../Ports/pc532/">pc532</a>).
<li>Power Macintosh (<a href="../Ports/macppc/">macppc</a>).

<DATE>new_www.netbsd.org 31 Aug 1998 - www.NetBSD.org switches to new machine
www.NetBSD.org has been switched from a '486 to a Pentium II machine,
and also moved to UPS power, thus providing faster and (hopefully)
more reliable service.

<DATE>uvm_improvements 31 Aug 1998 - UVM improvements, plus i386 and arm32 switch
<p>
<a href="../Ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a> and <a
href="../Ports/arm32/">NetBSD/arm32</a> have switched over to
the new <a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a> virtual
memory system.
</p>
<p>
Over the last few days, Jason Thorpe has been making some improvements
to the way UVM allocates some of its data structures. On the Alpha and
MIPS platforms, many UVM data structures are now mapped via the KSEG,
which will avoid TLB thrashing on these platforms.  On others, many
structures are now mapped via the kernel_map, instead of the kmem_map,
which means that the kmem_map is a lot less likely to suffer a resource
shortage.
</p>
<p>
These changes now make it possible for UVM to run on large memory x86
systems without additional tweaks to default parameters (a similar
problem existed to a lesser extent on mac68k systems, as well).
Because this problem is now fixed, I have switched the x86 port to use
UVM+PMAP_NEW by default.

<DATE>new_source_changes_format 07 Aug 1998 - New format of source-changes
A long standing bugbear has been the somewhat unhelpful format of the
source-changes list (which records all changes to the NetBSD source trees).
The format has now been changed to compact multiple-directory commits into one
message. A hypothetical example of the new output would look like:

<DATE>4front_oss 12 Jul 1998 - 4Front releases Open Sound System
OSS provides sound card drivers for most popular sound cards
under NetBSD. These drivers support digital audio, MIDI, Synthesizers
and mixers found on sound cards. These sound drivers comply with the
Open Sound System API specification.<br>

<DATE>usb 13 Jul 1998 - NetBSD is first to support USB

<p>
NetBSD-current is now the first free operating system to support the Universal
Serial Bus.
</p>

<h4>Supported Now</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>A UHCI (the Intel standard) host controller driver.</li>
<li>A OHCI (everyone else's standard) host controller driver.</li>
<li>A host controller independent framework for handling the
    devices.  This framework presents a mostly USBDI compliant
    interface to the drivers.</li>
<li>Power budgeting.</li>
<li>A hub driver.</li>
<li>A mouse driver.</li>
<li>A keyboard driver for keyboards supporting the boot protocol.</li>
<li>A generic HID (Human Interface Device) driver for
    those devices that do not have a special driver.</li>
<li>A printer driver.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Work in Progress</h4>

<ul>
<li>Support for all kinds of transfers (control, interrupt, bulk,
    and isochronous).</li>
<li>Bandwidth budgeting.</li>
<li>A totally generic driver to handle leftover devices.</li>
<li>An audio driver.</li>
</ul>

<!--
	What we don't have:
	- Proper handling of devices that are disconnected.  NetBSD lacks
	  the functionality for this.
	- Suspend/resume handling.  I think this is simply a matter of
	  sitting down and writing some code.
	- A communication class driver.
	- Drivers for a lot of proprietary devices.
	- Loadable device drivers.

<DATE>new_alpha_snapshot 06 Jul 1998 - New alpha support and snapshot

<p>
There is a new snapshot available on ftp.NetBSD.org and on the mirror sites.
This is a complete snapshot, with X, an updated toolchain source module,
and instructions. The toolchain binaries are merged into the standard sets
as with 1.3.2.
</p>

<h4>Complete snapshot</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>includes an updated toolchain, incorporating binutils 2.8.1,
    the strip(1) bug is fixed, nicer as(1), etc.</li>
<li>includes X: <em>xbase.tgz, xfont.tgz, xcomp.tgz, xserver.tgz,
    xcontrib.tgz</em></li>
<li>includes installation instructions</li>
<li>Available at:
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/snapshot/19980628/">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/snapshot/19980628/</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Many new platforms</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>AlphaServer 4100   <em>(Rawhide)</em></li>
<li>AlphaServer 1000   <em>(Mikasa, Mikasa+Pinnacle)</em></li>
<li>AlphaServer 1000A  <em>(Noritake, Noritake+Pinnacle, Corelle)</em></li>
<li>ALPHABook 1                       <em>(AlphaBook 1)</em></li>
<li>Digital Personal Workstation (550) <em>(Miata)</em></li>
<li>EB66</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In some cases this support is at a rather experimental stage.
We would really appreciate it if people with access to any of
these systems would try the new snapshot, or at least boot the
floppy and see what happens. Other systems with systypes in the
above list--like the Alphaserver 800--should also be working now.
</p>

<p>
Support for the 4100 is not on the install floppy, but if you have
one we will be happy to make a floppy for you.
</p>

<h4>Other -current features</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>PCMCIA</li>
<li><a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a>.  This is
    the first release with the userland compiled for UVM and with a
    UVM INSTALL and GENERIC kernel, featuring clustered pageout,
    faster image startup, and other performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Things to look out for</h4>

<p>
The X server hasn't been tested, and is probably temporarily broken
due to currently active framebuffer console development. I expect
this will be fixed shortly. The bootfloppy still doesn't support
the turbochannel systems.
</p>

<p>
As usual, don't try to update userland and expect to boot an old
kernel.
</p>

<h4>TURBOchannel-based Alphas</h4>
A boot floppy for TURBOchannel <a
href="../Ports/alpha/">Alphas</a> with keyboard support is
available.  This would be usable for maintenance. A kernel image with
keyboard and mouse support is also available. With these, you can
install the latest snapshot without serial console.  See:  <a

<DATE>pciide 15 Jun 1998 - Improved IDE support for NetBSD/i386
Manuel Bouyer has ported the work done to the ide system for netbsd-current
in the bouyer-ide branch back to 1.3.2. This adds support for isapnp, pcmcia
and pci IDE controllers (with DMA and ultra-DMA/33 support, and also supports
the 2 channels on the CMD 0640), and ATAPI floppy drives (such as Iomega ZIP
or LS120).  It's available from:
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/ide-1.3.2/">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/ide-1.3.2/</a>

<DATE>next68k 09 Jun 1998 - next68k port added
It's still very "experimental," but it does now netboot and run with a
serial port console well enough to compile itself.  There is no support
for the scsi disk, keyboard, display or other NeXT "extras" yet.

<DATE>netbsd-1.3.2 29 May 1998 - NetBSD 1.3.2 released

<p>
The NetBSD project is pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.3.2.
</p>

<p>
This release fixes bugs found in the 1.3 and 1.3.1 releases --
including recently discovered security holes in BIND and other
software.  We urge users on the Internet to upgrade their systems.
</p>

<p>
This release also updates our version of The X Window System from
XFree86 release 3.3.1 to XFree86 3.3.2, with security patches.
</p>

<p>
The release binaries and source are in the usual location, at:
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.2/">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.2/</a>

<DATE>alpha_ipnat_floppy 26 May 1998 - alpha news, IPNAT and floppy support

<h4>IPNAT</h4>

<p>
The 64-bit bugs with ipnat have been fixed and patches and instructions
can be found in:
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/ipnatfix/">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/ipnatfix/</a>
</p>

<p>
An example ipnat startup might look like this. For de0 and de1, say,
and if both are already ifconfig'ed:
<pre>	sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
	ipf -E
	ipnat -f /etc/ipnat.conf
	dhcpd de1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The contents of ipnat.conf:
<pre>	map de0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32 portmap tcp/udp 1024:65535
	map de0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32
</pre>
</p>

<h4>GENERIC FLOPPY</h4>

<p>
A floppy that boots up a fairly recent 1.3E GENERIC kernel is now available in:
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/genfloppy">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha/genfloppy</a>
</p>

<p>
Note that this is the first floppy that supports the TURBOchannel alphas.
I hope to also have a ramdisk INSTALL floppy for the 3000/xxx systems soon,
but this one should make installs possible given a DHCP or BOOTP server
and an NFS root with the base set installed.

<DATE>macppc 18 May 1998 - PowerMacintosh port committed to NetBSD-current

<p>
It runs on (at least) PowerMac 7300, 8600, 9500, and 9600.
</p>

<h4>Supported devices</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>on-board 53c9x SCSI</li>
<li>MACE ethernet</li>
<li>serial ports</li>
<li>ADB keyboard and mouse</li>
<li>NE2000 compatible ethernet</li>
<li>3c905 ethernet</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Devices <em>not</em> supported</h4>

<p><ul>
<li>on-board MESH SCSI</li>
<li>floppy disk</li>
<li>audio</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Additional considerations</h4>
<p>
Currently <a href="../Ports/macppc/">NetBSD/macppc</a> uses
linuxppc's milo for primary boot, but it is not included in source tree
because of GPL.  Tsubai Masanari is planning on rewriting it shortly.

<DATE>network_hippi 15 May 1998 - Changes to network code, timestamps and HIPPI

<ul>
<p>
<li><p>Monotonically increasing "current time" timestamps have been
    added to the fast and slow timeout dispatch routines.  These
    can be used to implement network timers which compare "current
    time" against "when timer will expire", which can can reduce
    read/modify/write/compare/branch cycles to read/compare/branch,
    or used for time-ordered timeout queues.  TCP timers and the SYN
    cache timers now use this PRT timer facility, which has resulted
    in much less expensive timer expiration loops.

<DATE>more_uvm 03 May 1998 - alpha, hp300, mac68k, mvme68k, and sparc switch to UVM
	
<p>
NetBSD/hp300, NetBSD/mac68k, and NetBSD/mvme68k have switched over
to the new <a href="../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a> virtual
memory system.
</p>

<p>
Hats off to all the folks who worked on UVM to make it happen:
first and foremost, Chuck Cranor, who designed and implemented UVM,
Matthew Green, who handled integration issues and wrote the swap
subsystem, and Chuck Silvers, who wrote the anonymous memory pager
(which added support for shared memory).
