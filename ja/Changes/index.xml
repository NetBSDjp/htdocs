  <sect3 id="puffs+refuse">
    <title>13 Mar 2007 - Filesystems in User-Space: puffs, refuse vs. FUSE, and more</title>

    <para>
NetBSD now offers full support for running file systems in userspace.
The core component inside the kernel that exposes a file system
interface towards the userland programs is "puffs", and communicates
with vnodes, the kernel's own idea of files.  The "libpuffs" library
is the interface between userland file systems and the kernel
component.  To facilitate running the huge amount of file systems
already available for the FUSE interface, but not dictate the
capabilities of puffs by it, it was decided that FUSE support should
be provided as a compatibility layer on top of the native puffs
interface. This compatibility is offered by re-fuse, a BSD-licensed
re-implementation of FUSE. It is designed to be source code compatible
with FUSE, and more information can be found in the refuse(3) manpage.
    </para>

    <para>
While puffs is stable for users, the library programming interface and
the binary interfaces are still likely to change, and therefore puffs
and the dependant librefuse are not built by default.  For people
tracking -current, the build of all relevant puffs components
(librefuse, psshfs, etc.) by "<command>make build</command>" can be enabled by adding
"<literal>MKPUFFS=yes</literal>" to <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename>.
Using puffs also requires the kernel option "<literal>file-system
PUFFS</literal>", or alternatively loading the puffs.o kernel module,
which is included in a puffs-enabled build.
    </para>

    <para>
FUSE compatibility was added within pkgsrc, and besides the required
infrastructure work a number of FUSE packages were added to pkgsrc in the
new "filesystem" category. Example packages that are currently available
include:

    <para>
puffs was originally developed during the Google Summer of Code 2005
"<ulink url="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/userfs/">userfs</ulink>" project by Antti Kantee.
It was further polished using funding
from the Ulla Tuominen Foundation and committed
into the NetBSD source tree in October 2006. 
The work was presented at AsiaBSDCon 2007 in a paper
entitled "puffs - Pass-to-Userspace Framework File System".
The "refuse" library was
written by Alistair Crooks and committed to NetBSD in February
2007. All components will be available in NetBSD releases starting
with NetBSD 5. Work for using FUSE-enabled packages via pkgsrc was
done by Juan Romero Pardines following import of the "refuse" library.

  <sect3 id="ipv6-fastforward">
    <title>11 Mar 2007 - IPv6 Fast Forward</title>

    <para>
      IPv6 Fast Forward has been integrated into NetBSD.
      This is the counterpart to IPv4 Fast Forward, and is implemented by
      using flows.  
      Each  flow of packets describes a connection between two end points.
      The flow caches details like the route used, and it's accessed using
      simple hashing techniques. 
      This technique allows IPv6 forwarding to use a lot less CPU resources,
      which may be scarce on legacy and/or embedded systems, 
      and throughput is effectively limited by the bus bandwidth and the
      network driver's performance only.
    </para>

    <para>
      To enable IPv6 Fast Forward, your kernel must be built with
      "options GATEWAY". The ip6.maxflows sysctl can be used to set
      the maximum number of cached flows, a value of 0 disables IPv6 Fast
      Forwarding.  See the &man.options.4; and &man.sysctl.7; manpages
      for more information.

    <title>07 Mar 2007 - Getting ready for Google Summer of Code
    2007</title>

    <para>The NetBSD Project is getting ready to participate as a
    mentoring organization in the Google <ulink
    url="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</ulink> 2007
    program.  We would like to pick as many students as possible &mdash;
    which basically depends on the amount of applications we receive
    &mdash;, hoping to acquire some nice contributions by the end of
    summer.  Naturally, though, we would like to get these contributors
    to become really involved with the project, staying with us after
    the program has finished.  Some of the students from previous years
    have been already promoted to <ulink
    url="../People/developers.html">NetBSD Developers</ulink>, so you
    can be too!</para>

    <para>Students will be allowed to apply from the 14th to the 24th of
    this month through Google's web application.  In order to do so,
    please first check the list of <ulink
    url="../contrib/soc-projects.html">proposed SoC projects</ulink> to
    see what is of most interest to NetBSD.  Keep in mind that this list
    is in constant extension, and will be even during the period in
    which candidates can apply; check it periodically.  Of course, you
    are also allowed to present a personalized project proposal that is
    not listed in that page, but be aware that in such case we will need
    to find a mentor for you and might not be able to do so on time.
    At last, you might also check for other ideas in the <ulink
    url="../contrib/projects.html">projects list</ulink>, although most
    of these are out of the scope of the Summer of Code and/or lack
    mentors.</para>

    <para>Once you have decided on a project, take some time to read the
    <ulink url="../contrib/soc-application.html">Project Application
    HowTo</ulink>, which will aid you in filling your proposal.  When
    writing your application, please be as verbose as possible; short
    applications (with very rare exceptions) are quickly discarded
    because they feel incomplete.  It may take you a long time to write
    something valuable, but your time will be well spent.</para>

    <title>27 Feb 2007 - Daylight Saving Time Changes: Nothing new for NetBSD</title>
    <para>
Daylight Saving Time (DST) was extended in a number of countries starting
in 2007.  For example, beginning in 2007, most of the USA will begin
Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m. on the second Sunday in March and revert
to standard time on the first Sunday in November.  While this has caused a
number of software vendors a lot of headache, NetBSD has shipped with the
appropriate timezone files for years; even though changes to timezones
in general and DST rules in particular happen a few times a year
throughout the world, the NetBSD operating system has of course always
provided accurate and up to date zone files as soon as possible.
    </para>
    <para>
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed into USA law on August 8, 2005.
The updated tzdata package (tzdata2005m) was imported into our source tree
on August 29, 2005, and was pulled up into the netbsd-2 (September 5,
2005), netbsd-2-0 and netbsd-3 (both September 6, 2005) branches and is
thus present in NetBSD 2.0.3, 2.1, 3.0, 3.0.1, 3.1 and the 4.x branches.
    </para>
    <para>
<emphasis type="bold">In other words, if you're running one of these systems, no
action on your part is required;  your system is already prepared for the updated
timezones and will continue to show the correct local time.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
If you are running an older system, we strongly encourage you to update to
one of these releases.  However, we do recognize that some organizations
may have the need to continue to run older releases.  You can update those
systems as follows:
<programlisting>
  # cd src
  # cvs update share/zoneinfo
  # make install
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
Per default, /etc/localtime is a symbolic link to the actual timezone file
under /usr/share/zoneinfo.  However, if on your system / and /usr are not
on the same partition, you need to copy the zone file from
/usr/share/zoneinfo to /etc/localtime to make sure that services starting
before /usr is mounted get the correct time.
    </para>
    <para>
After installing the new zonefiles and making sure that /etc/localtime
points to the correct file, you need to restart any and all running
services that rely on the correct local time (such as crond, syslogd
etc.): /etc/localtime is only read once when the application starts up,
and any changes to that file are not picked up until the application is
restarted.
    </para>
    <para>
A reboot is not required, however, it is an easy way to make sure that all
services are restarted and pick up the new information.

      communication, dedicated 100M Ethernet networks are used in each
      system that connect the Route Processor Module (RPM) and line
      cards that are for system control. 
      There are three active CPUs on the primary RPM, and a CPU on
      each line card that are all active in the control
      plane.

      The NetBSD release engineering would like to announce that we

      originally started back in August 2006, with a goal of releasing by

      branch during several hackathons, it was decided to restart the
      NetBSD 4.0 release process, instead of identifying and pulling all

which was available via the C&amp;L FreeX magazine. J&ouml;rg has now
updated his Live CD to this millennium's state of NetBSD, and released the
2007 Edition of his NetBSD Live! CD.
The CD is based on NetBSD 4.0_BETA/i386 and offers a full desktop
environment by using a compressed filesystem, which includes KDE, Abiword,
Dia, Inkscape, GIMP, Firefox, xmms and many more.
