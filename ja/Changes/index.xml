    <para>CARP is the Common Address Redundancy Protocol, developed

    of hosts on the same network segment (known as <quote>redundancy
    group</quote>) to share an IP address, and in the event that
    the master host suffers a failure, the IP will move to one of

<para>By calculations of &a.agc;, at the end of December 2005,
there were 5779 packages in the Packages Collection, up from 5737
the previous month, a rise of 42.</para>

<para>The pkgsrc team branched the pkgsrc repository, and released
the <ulink url="#pkgsrc2005q4">pkgsrc-2005Q4 branch</ulink> in
December. The pkgsrc-2005Q3 branch has been deprecated, and continuing
engineering has started on pkgsrc-2005Q4. We're quite proud of the
new branch - we hope you enjoy it.</para>

<para>The Package of the Month award goes to Eterm (<filename
role="pkg">x11/eterm</filename>). <quote>I've been using it as my
terminal program of choice for over 6 years, and recently I enabled
the Escreen mode with it.  The Escreen mode interacts with screen
- <filename role="pkg">misc/screen</filename> - in a seamless way,
provides tabbed access to screen windows, and integrates frequent
screen commands in an Eterm menu. Highly recommended.</quote> - says

<para>&a.jmmv; has published documentation about file system internals
in the form of a new on-line book: the <ulink

design and implementation of NetBSD, including its kernel and user-land
utilities.</para>

<para>Most of this text was written during tmpfs development &mdash; his
Google Summer of Code project &mdash; as one of its goals was precisely
to write such documentation.</para>

<para>Please note that this documentation is still incomplete and very
much work-in-progress.  Feedback, fixes and extensions are certainly
welcome.</para>
