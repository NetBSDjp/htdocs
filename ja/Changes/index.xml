  <title>22 Feb 2006 - NetBSD iSCSI Status and HOWTOs</title>

  <para>&a.agc; has recently added support for an iSCSI target to
    NetBSD, and written HOWTOs for using it.  iSCSI is specified
    in RFC 3720 and describes a method for encapsulating SCSI
    commands in TCP/IP to remotely access block-level storage.  In
    iSCSI, the party offering a SCSI device (the server) is called
    a <quote>target</quote>, and the party using that device (the
    client) is called an <quote>initiator</quote>, so the iSCSI
    target exports blocks to the iSCSI initiators.</para>
  <para>NetBSD's iSCSI implementation was developed from the original
    Intel code (BSD-licensed) and has been tested with version 1.06
    of the Microsoft initiator as well as with its own test harness;
    an iSCSI initiator for NetBSD is currently under development.</para>

terminal program of choice for over 6 years, and recently I enabled
the Escreen mode with it.  The Escreen mode interacts with screen
- <filename role="pkg">misc/screen</filename> - in a seamless way,
provides tabbed access to screen windows, and integrates frequent
screen commands in an Eterm menu. Highly recommended.</quote> - says
