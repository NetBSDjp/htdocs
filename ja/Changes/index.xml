previous branches (5551 packages supported on 13 platforms).  As

starts on the <literal>pkgsrc-2005Q3</literal> branch.</para>

<title>30 Sep 2004 - NetBSD again sets Internet2 Land Speed World Record</title>

<para>
    NetBSD does it again: after the original Internet2 Land Speed Record
    <ulink url="#internet2-landspeed">set by NetBSD in 2004 May 3</ulink> was broken,
    NetBSD shines again: Once more researchers at the Swedish University
    Network (SUNET) have broken the Internet2 Land Speed Record, using the
    upcoming version of NetBSD 2.0.
</para>
    <para>
    The new records are 124.935 Pbmps in a single stream (was 69.073 Pbmps),
    and 122.367 Pbmps in multiple streams. NetBSD was used once more due to the
    <quote>scalability of it's TCP code</quote>.
</para>
    <para>
    More information about this record including the NetBSD
    configuration can be found at: <ulink
    url="http://proj.sunet.se/LSR3-s/">http://proj.sunet.se/LSR3-s/</ulink> for
    single stream and <ulink 
    url="http://proj.sunet.se/LSR3-m">http://proj.sunet.se/LSR3-m/</ulink> for
    multiple streams.

<title>27 Sep 2004 - NetBSD 2.0 RC1 tagged</title>

<para>
   The NetBSD Releng Team has announced that the first Release Candidate for
   NetBSD 2.0 (ie NetBSD-2.0_RC1) has been tagged.  This is a major milestone
   in the much anticipated release of NetBSD 2.0:
   from now on, any pullups must address some form of show-stopping issue to
   even be considered. The NetBSD Project encourages all users to test the
   binary snapshots that will soon be available on the <ulink
   url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/">release engineering ftp server</ulink>.
</para>
   <para>
   If no pullups are necessary, then the 2.0 release should
   occur around the middle of October.  Any fixes resulting in pullups will
   cause a second RC cycle to begin and add approximately 1-2 weeks more to
   the timeline.

<para>
   The server hosting www.NetBSD.org and mail-index.NetBSD.org suffered a

   is working on getting the machine up and running, but in the mean time
   www.NetBSD.org was switched to one of our mirrors.  The mailing list index
   remains temporarily unavailable, but our news gateway at <ulink
