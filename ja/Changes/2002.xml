<para>
Brett Lymn has added verified exec to -current, which verifies a
cryptographic hash before allowing execution of binaries and scripts.
As the name implies, verified exec compares the hash of a file against
its previously defined hash and execution is only allowed if the hash
matches.

This can be used to prevent a system from running binaries or scripts
which have been illegally modified or installed. Verified exec can also
be used to limit the use of script interpreters to authorized scripts
only and disallow interactive use.

</para>
    <para>
    These advisories involve bugs in libc (affecting static binaries), as
    well as the kernel.  A full system rebuild is recommended to
    collectively address all of these issues, but please make sure to read
    through all of the advisories in case specific issues affect your
    system.
</para>
    <para>
    Because of the extensive rebuild required, the NetBSD 1.6 release was
    delayed in order to include fixes for as many of these issues as
    possible, so as to provide binary release users with an easy upgrade
    path.
</para>
    <para>
    Readers will note that there are some gaps in the above numbering.
    These pending advisories involve third parties, and are awaiting
    disclosure co-ordination, so we cannot publish them at this time.
    However, they <emphasis>are</emphasis> fixed in NetBSD 1.6.
</para>
    <para>
    Unfortunately, the recent 1.5.3 release was affected by most of these
    issues. Unlike NetBSD 1.6, the 1.5 branch cannot be automatically
    cross-built to release, and so any updated binary release from the 1.5
    tree will take considerable time and developer effort.
</para>
    <para>

FREENIX Presenter:   Nathan J. Williams, Wasabi Systems Inc. 
Description:

This paper presents the design and implementation of a two-level thread
scheduling system on NetBSD. This system provides a foundation for efficient
and flexible threads on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor machines. The work
is based on the scheduler activations kernel interface proposed by Anderson et
al. for user-level control of parallelism in the presence of multiprogramming
and multiprocessing.

<html:pre>
BSD BOF: Serra Ballroom II (Marriott Hotel)

BOF Date &amp; Time: Thursday June 13th, 7:00-7:30PM
BOF Title:       The NetBSD Project
BOF Presenter:    Christos Zoulas
Description:

NetBSD is the most portable operating system in the world, supporting
52 platforms on 12 processor families. In this BOF we will present
last year's work and achievements, explain the delays in release
engineering for 1.6, and give the status of the major features
currently under development: i386 smp, devsw, kqueue, scheduler
activations. Finally we'll talk about the package source improvements
planned such as advanced linking and multi-version package support.


BOF Date &amp; Time: Thursday June 13th, 9:30-10:30PM
BOF Title:     BSD Panel Session moderated by Marshall Kirk McKusick
BOF Presenter: Christos Zoulas (NetBSD), Todd Miller (OpenBSD),
               Robert Watson (FreeBSD), Mike Karels (BSD/OS),
               Ernest Prabhakar (Darwin)
Description:

Representatives from the BSD groups will answer audience
questions and prognosticate on the future of BSD. This panel
is your opportunity to ask all your BSD interoperability
questions.

<para>
<html:pre>
COMPLETE STEPS:
         
May 22          ** Feature cutoff -- no new feature or 3RDPARTY pullups **
 \              ** after this point **
         
May 22-         Create netbsd-1-6 branch, name kernel version 1.6_BETA1.
 \              (Increment trunk to 1.6A.)
         
**       
         
IN PROCESS STEPS:

  \      
   \            Build 1.6_BETA1 snapshots daily; fix compilation bugs.
    \           Test 1.6_BETA1 binaries (including installers).
     \          Portmaster-delegated builder preps X sets for platforms with
June 2          X servers.

(Note that _BETA1 is slightly longer than should be for a _BETA phase, but
this is to give a little leeway to shake out the new structure.  Typically
_BETA cycles should be 7 days.)

June 2          ** Critical pullup cutoff - only security, build, sysinst **
 \              ** and other release critical pullups after this point **

June 3-         Make kernel version 1.6_BETA2.
 \              Build 1.6_BETA2 snapshots daily; fix compilation bugs.
  \             Test 1.6_BETA2 binaries (including installers).
   \
    \           If there were any X11 pullups in _BETA1, the
June 9          portmaster-delegated builder rebuilds X sets.

[7 days]        Optional additional _BETAn cycle(s) as determined by releng;
                these will slide the following dates accordingly.


June 10-        Tag 1.6_RC1.  Build binaries and X sets once.  Test.
June 13

[4 days]        Optional additional _RCn cycle(s) as determined by releng;
                these will slide the following dates accordingly.

June 14         Tag 1.6.  Rebuild base sets for new kernel version.  (X sets
                should propagate as-is from a prior build.)

June 15-        Set up distribution tree; factor out shareable tarballs;
 \              create distribution global doc (CHANGES, etc.) files.
  \
June 18         Open 1.6 to mirrors.

June 19         Open 1.6 to the world and announce it.

June 19-        Begin open-ended phase before 1.6.1 release cycle.

<para>

Michael Rauch has worked hard to get OpenOffice working on NetBSD, and
a package is now available in <filename role="pkg">misc/openoffice</filename>.  The package was
tested on NetBSD 1.5.3_ALPHA and -current. As Java (Version 2 - JDK
1.3 or newer) is needed to build OpenOffice, this currently limits the
list of platforms to i386. When current Java implementations start
becoming available for other NetBSD platforms, it is expected that
OpenOffice will appear on these platforms as well.
</para>
<para>

OpenOffice is the Open Source version of the StarOffice office
application suite. Its mission statement is to create the leading
international office suite, running on all major platforms and
providing access to all functionality and data through open-component
based APIs and an XML-based file format.
</para>
<para>

To build OpenOffice.org version 641 from source, update pkgsrc and then
type "make install" in <filename role="pkg">misc/openoffice</filename>.  
A binary package compiled for
NetBSD 1.5.3_ALPHA/i386 with XFree 4.2.0 is available as
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.5/i386/All/openoffice-641.tgz">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.5/i386/All/openoffice-641.tgz</ulink>. As
the NetBSD 1.5.x releases are binary-compatible, this binary package
will also install and run fine on any NetBSD/i386 1.5-based machine.
If you experience any problems, please report them in the usual way
via send-pr.

</para>
<para>
In order to use the new version, update your NetBSD-current source tree, 
recompile your kernel and recompile the userland IPFilter tools. For 
example, to rebuild the userland part:
<programlisting>
cd /usr/src/sys &amp;&amp; make includes
cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/ipf &amp;&amp; make dependall install</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
After rebooting a new kernel with IPFilter 3.4.23 enabled, you should see
<programlisting>
IP Filter: v3.4.23 initialized.  Default = pass all, Logging = enabled</programlisting>
in your boot messages.
</para>
<para>
The new version has been tested on i386 and sparc64 systems. If you have 
any problems with it, please report them with &man.send-pr.1;.

<title>26 Jan 2002 - NetBSD System Packages supported in -current</title> 
<para>
Jim Wise has committed changes to 
<ulink url="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink> for a 
packaging system for the NetBSD base install. This will
allow for binary components of the NetBSD base system to be easily
installed, removed and upgraded. It is hoped that these changes will 
be included in the next major release of NetBSD.
</para>
<para>
For example, it will be possible to cleanly remove large
components (e.g. the compilers, &man.named.8;, &man.sendmail.8;, etc) from 
a NetBSD system without affecting system integrity. It allows the
user to have a finer control over what is installed on their
system. Security updates and bug fixes can now be provided as 
package upgrades, which will make maintaining NetBSD systems 
a lot easier.
</para>
<para>
For more information about the system, see
<ulink url="http://cvsweb.NetBSD.org/bsdweb.cgi/distrib/syspkg/notes/NOTES">/distrib/syspkg/notes/NOTES</ulink> or in distrib/syspkg/notes
in an up to date NetBSD-current source tree.

<title>26 Jan 2002 - Ntpd security enhancement</title> 
<para>
Recently, Emmanuel Dreyfus has committed some work on a pseudo-device
named clockctl to <ulink url="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink>. 
This driver offers 
alternative entry points to the time setting related system calls 
&man.settimeofday.2;, &man.clock.settime.2;, &man.adjtime.2; and &man.ntp.adjtime.2; via a 
device file called /dev/clockctl. The access to these calls are
dependent on the permissions on the /dev/clockctl file; that
is, if a user can write to it, then the user is allowed to
change the system time. As a result, daemons such as &man.ntpd.8;
can be run chrooted and under a non-root UID.
</para>
<para>
In order to use this new functionality, make sure you have
an up to date NetBSD-current source tree and add the
following to your kernel config file and rebuild it:
<programlisting>
pseudo-device       clockctl</programlisting>
If you don't have an ntpd user and group on your system, you
need to add this to your passwd and group files. In future
releases of NetBSD, this will be UID 15, GID 15 and with
/var/chroot/ntpd for the home directory.
</para>
<para>
To create the clockctl device file, make sure that your
MAKEDEV file is up to date, change to the /dev directory and run:
<programlisting>
./MAKEDEV clockctl</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
This file is made mode 660 root/ntpd. Once you have done
this you can run ntpd as a non-root user:
<programlisting>
ntpd -u ntpd:ntpd</programlisting>
There is also a -t chrootdir option.

<title>05 Jan 2002 - MIPS-based NetBSD ports switched to the new
toolchain</title> 
<para>
    Jason Thorpe has recently switched the NetBSD MIPS-based ports to use
    the new GCC 2.95.3/Binutils 2.11.2-based toolchain. Rafal Boni has put
    a great deal of effort into making the toolchain work on the MIPS ports. 
    The change has been tested on an
    Algorithmics P-5064 and also on some SGI machines.
</para>
    <para>
    If you use these ports and you are about to update to a recent version 
    of <ulink url="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink>, it is vital 
    that you install the new ld.elf_so first to cope with an ABI change 
    in the new toolchain. The build.sh
    script supplied with the NetBSD-current sources can be used to build the
    system. If you use a MIPS-based port and you encounter problems with the 
    change, please send a bug report with &man.send-pr.1;.

<title>04 Jan 2002 - NetBSD/acorn32 X server support for wscons</title> 
<para>
    Ben Harris has made modifications to Xarm32VIDC (the X server used by
    <ulink url="../Ports/acorn32/">NetBSD/acorn32</ulink>) so that it works 
    with &man.wscons.4;. This means that it works on the Acorn NC. 

    There is a binary snapshot of the modified <ulink 
    url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/acorn32/misc/Xarm32VIDC-wscons.gz">Xarm32VIDC 
    server</ulink> which should be compatible with NetBSD 1.5 or above.

    <para>
    It should be noted that this work is in its early stages. In particular,  
    keyboard support needs to be improved and there is no proper screen
    blanking or DPMS support. However the software is usable.
