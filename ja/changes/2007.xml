  <title>19 Dec 2007 - NetBSD 4.0 released</title>
  <para> The  NetBSD  Project  is  pleased  to announce that release 4.0 of the
   NetBSD operating system is now available.</para>
 
 <para>
   Major achievements in NetBSD 4.0 include support for version 3 of the
   Xen virtual machine  monitor, Bluetooth, many new device drivers and
   embedded platforms  based  on ARM, PowerPC and MIPS CPUs. New network
   services  include  iSCSI target (server) code and an implementation of
   the  Common  Address  Redundancy  Protocol.  Also, system security was
   further  enhanced  with  restrictions  of  mprotect(2)  to enforce W^X
   policies,  the Kernel Authorization framework, and improvements of the
   Veriexec  file  integrity  subsystem,  which can be used to harden the
   system  against trojan horses and virus attacks.
 </para>
 <para>NetBSD 4.0 runs on 54  different system architectures featuring 17
   machine  architectures  across  17 distinct CPU families, and is being
   ported  to  more.  The  NetBSD  4.0  release  contains complete binary
   releases  for 51 different machine types, with the platforms amigappc,
   bebox  and  ews4800mips  released in source form only. Complete source
   and  binaries  for NetBSD 4.0 are available for download at many sites
   around  the  world.  A  list of download sites providing FTP, AnonCVS,
   SUP,  and  other services is provided at the end of this announcement;
   the  latest  list  of  available  download  sites may also be found at
   <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/mirrors/"/>.
</para>
<para>
  NetBSD  4.0  is dedicated to the memory of Jun-Ichiro "itojun" Hagino,
  who  died  in  October  2007. Itojun was a member of the KAME project,
  which  provided  IPv6  and  IPsec support; he was also a member of the
  NetBSD core team, and one of  the  Security Officers.

    <title>12 Nov 2007 - Automated Testing Framework imported into NetBSD-current</title>

    <para>Julio M. Merino Vidal has imported his Google Summer of Code
    2007 project, the <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/atf/">Automated Testing
    Framework (ATF)</ulink>, into the NetBSD-current tree.  Version 0.1
    was reached when the program ended and development continued
    afterwards until the 0.3 release, which is the one that has been
    imported.  This project was mentored by Martin Husemann.</para>

    <para>ATF provides a new infrastructure to easily create and run
    test cases.  The main goal is to provide a tool that allows end
    users to verify that their installation of the system works as
    expected and a way for developers to detect regressions as soon as
    they appear.  In order to demonstrate this functionality, some
    subtrees of the regress source tree have been converted to the new
    framework; we expect that all of them will be migrated eventually,
    and we will be adding many tests for functionality that still does
    not have any.</para>

    <title>02 Nov 2007 - In Memoriam of Itojun</title>
    <para>
Jun-Ichiro itojun Hagino joined the NetBSD project in June of 1999. In
the eight years since that time, he contributed many hours to the
betterment of the project.
    </para>
    
    <para>
In addition to his work on the KAME project, which provided NetBSD's
IPv6 and IPsec support, Itojun also participated as a member of the Core
Group, which leads the development of NetBSD by making technical design
decisions. Itojun also contributed as a member of the Security-Officer
team.
    </para>
    
    <para>
Due to Itojun's efforts, NetBSD was the first open source operating
system with a production ready IPv6 networking stack, which was included
in the base system before many people knew what IPv6 was.
    </para>
    
    <para>
Those of us who had the pleasure of meeting him in person enjoyed his
demeanor and company, and his absence will be noted by all.

    <title>25 Jul 2007 - NetBSD hires Andrew Doran for full-time SMP development</title>
    <para>
      The NetBSD Foundation announces that it has hired Andrew
      Doran to work full-time on improving symmetrical multi-processing
      (SMP) in NetBSD. This work is made possible through a generous
      donation by Force10 Networks and internal funding by The
      NetBSD Foundation.
    </para>

    <para>
      Andrew Doran is an independent, Dublin based Unix systems consultant with special interest in 
      building scalable systems. He has been a NetBSD developer since 1999 and is currently working on 
      the transition from a big-lock SMP implementation to a fine-grained model, which allows multiple
      CPUs to execute code in kernel context simultaneously. Hiring Andrew full-time will boost work in 
      this area, with the final result of a SMP implementation that is ready for tomorrow's
      multi-core-CPUs.

  <sect3 id="puffs+refuse">
    <title>13 Mar 2007 - Filesystems in User-Space: puffs, refuse vs. FUSE, and more</title>

    <para>
NetBSD now offers full support for running file systems in userspace.
The core component inside the kernel that exposes a file system
interface towards the userland programs is "puffs", and communicates
with vnodes, the kernel's own idea of files.  The "libpuffs" library
is the interface between userland file systems and the kernel
component.  To facilitate running the huge amount of file systems
already available for the FUSE interface, but not dictate the
capabilities of puffs by it, it was decided that FUSE support should
be provided as a compatibility layer on top of the native puffs
interface. This compatibility is offered by re-fuse, a BSD-licensed
re-implementation of FUSE. It is designed to be source code compatible
with FUSE, and more information can be found in the refuse(3) manpage.
    </para>

    <para>
While puffs is stable for users, the library programming interface and
the binary interfaces are still likely to change, and therefore puffs
and the dependant librefuse are not built by default.  For people
tracking -current, the build of all relevant puffs components
(librefuse, psshfs, etc.) by "<command>make build</command>" can be enabled by adding
"<literal>MKPUFFS=yes</literal>" to <filename>/etc/mk.conf</filename>.
Using puffs also requires the kernel option "<literal>file-system
PUFFS</literal>", or alternatively loading the puffs.o kernel module,
which is included in a puffs-enabled build.
    </para>

    <para>
FUSE compatibility was added within pkgsrc, and besides the required
infrastructure work a number of FUSE packages were added to pkgsrc in the
new "filesystem" category. Example packages that are currently available
include:

    <para>
puffs was originally developed during the Google Summer of Code 2005
"<ulink url="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/userfs/">userfs</ulink>" project by Antti Kantee.
It was further polished using funding
from the Ulla Tuominen Foundation and committed
into the NetBSD source tree in October 2006. 
The work was presented at AsiaBSDCon 2007 in a paper
entitled "puffs - Pass-to-Userspace Framework File System".
The "refuse" library was
written by Alistair Crooks and committed to NetBSD in February
2007. All components will be available in NetBSD releases starting
with NetBSD 5. Work for using FUSE-enabled packages via pkgsrc was
done by Juan Romero Pardines following import of the "refuse" library.

    <title>11 Mar 2007 - IPv6 Fast Forward</title>

    <para>
      IPv6 Fast Forward has been integrated into NetBSD.
      This is the counterpart to IPv4 Fast Forward, and is implemented by
      using flows.  
      Each  flow of packets describes a connection between two end points.
      The flow caches details like the route used, and it's accessed using
      simple hashing techniques. 
      This technique allows IPv6 forwarding to use a lot less CPU resources,
      which may be scarce on legacy and/or embedded systems, 
      and throughput is effectively limited by the bus bandwidth and the
      network driver's performance only.
    </para>

    <para>
      To enable IPv6 Fast Forward, your kernel must be built with
      "options GATEWAY". The ip6.maxflows sysctl can be used to set
      the maximum number of cached flows, a value of 0 disables IPv6 Fast
      Forwarding.  See the &man.options.4; and &man.sysctl.7; manpages
      for more information.

    see what is of most interest to NetBSD.  Keep in mind that this list

    which candidates can apply; check it periodically.  Of course, you
    are also allowed to present a personalized project proposal that is
    not listed in that page, but be aware that in such case we will need
    to find a mentor for you and might not be able to do so on time.
    At last, you might also check for other ideas in the <ulink

    of these are out of the scope of the Summer of Code and/or lack
    mentors.</para>

    writing your application, please be as verbose as possible; short

    <title>27 Feb 2007 - Daylight Saving Time Changes: Nothing new for NetBSD</title>
    <para>
Daylight Saving Time (DST) was extended in a number of countries starting
in 2007.  For example, beginning in 2007, most of the USA will begin
Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m. on the second Sunday in March and revert
to standard time on the first Sunday in November.  While this has caused a
number of software vendors a lot of headache, NetBSD has shipped with the
appropriate timezone files for years; even though changes to timezones
in general and DST rules in particular happen a few times a year
throughout the world, the NetBSD operating system has of course always
provided accurate and up to date zone files as soon as possible.
    </para>
    <para>
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed into USA law on August 8, 2005.
The updated tzdata package (tzdata2005m) was imported into our source tree
on August 29, 2005, and was pulled up into the netbsd-2 (September 5,
2005), netbsd-2-0 and netbsd-3 (both September 6, 2005) branches and is
thus present in NetBSD 2.0.3, 2.1, 3.0, 3.0.1, 3.1 and the 4.x branches.
    </para>
    <para>
<emphasis type="bold">In other words, if you're running one of these systems, no
action on your part is required;  your system is already prepared for the updated
timezones and will continue to show the correct local time.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
If you are running an older system, we strongly encourage you to update to
one of these releases.  However, we do recognize that some organizations
may have the need to continue to run older releases.  You can update those
systems as follows:
<programlisting>
  # cd src
  # cvs update share/zoneinfo
  # make install
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
Per default, /etc/localtime is a symbolic link to the actual timezone file
under /usr/share/zoneinfo.  However, if on your system / and /usr are not
on the same partition, you need to copy the zone file from
/usr/share/zoneinfo to /etc/localtime to make sure that services starting
before /usr is mounted get the correct time.
    </para>
    <para>
After installing the new zonefiles and making sure that /etc/localtime
points to the correct file, you need to restart any and all running
services that rely on the correct local time (such as crond, syslogd
etc.): /etc/localtime is only read once when the application starts up,
and any changes to that file are not picked up until the application is
restarted.
    </para>
    <para>
A reboot is not required, however, it is an easy way to make sure that all
services are restarted and pick up the new information.

      Some technical details that did not make it into the press
      release: Today, many of the worlds largest Gigabit Ethernet and
      10 Gigabit Ethernet networks depend on Force10 Networks. The
      <ulink
      url="http://www.force10networks.com/products/e-series_overview.asp">Force10
      TeraScale E-Series</ulink> switches/routers support this by
      providing features like massive scalability, 1260 Gigabit
      Ethernet ports or 224 Ten Gigabit Ethernet ports per
      chassis. The machines are battle tested and provide full
      function L2 switching and L3 routing.

      Internally, they are equipped with PowerPC CPUs, and for
      communication, dedicated 100M Ethernet networks are used in each
      system that connect the Route Processor Module (RPM) and line
      cards that are for system control. 
      There are three active CPUs on the primary RPM, and a CPU on
      each line card that are all active in the control
      plane.

      While data itself is forwarded by the hardware, management
      overhead exists if you consider running 1.500 VRRP groups, 600
      OSPF neighbors, BFD on thousands of ports, ARPs on thousands of
      ports, collecting statistics on thousands of ports etc.  All
      this work is done by <ulink
