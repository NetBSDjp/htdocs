    Darrin B. Jewell has spent some time reviving the SCSI effort for

    <para>
    Darrin will try to merge these into -current and possibly pull them up to
    the 1.5 branch in the near future.  There is additional work to do, such
    as getting a more functional &man.disklabel.8; and &man.installboot.8;
    going.  There are certainly still driver kinks that will need to be
    ironed out, but it seems we're over the hump.  If anyone is interested in
    picking up some of these pieces and hacking on them, please do.

<sect3 id="plex86">
<title>14 Dec 2000 - plex86 working on NetBSD/i386</title> 
<para>
    The virtual x86 machine emulator 'plex86' now works on a
    second Open Source operating system.  So far plex86 did only
    support Linux as host platform, and thanks to Frank van der
    Linden of Wasabi Systems (<ulink
    url="http://www.wasabisystems.com/">http://www.wasabisystems.com/</ulink>),
    it now also works on the i386 port of the NetBSD multi-platform
    operating system.
    </para>
    <para>
    Tested operating systems include FreeDOS beta 4, MS-DOS 6.22,
    Red Hat 6 Linux and NetBSD 1.5, stay tuned for more to come.
    Instead of doing full CPU instruction emulation, Plex86 runs
    native i386 code at full CPU speed, and only intercepts the
    code for system calls into the host platform as well as
    instructions that modify the machine state like trap or IO
    operations. Simply speaking, it is an open source version
    VMWare.
    </para>
    <para>
    Plex86 is currently still in early stages, so speed and device
    support are items that need improvement. However, they are
    being worked on by its creator, Kevin Lawton.
    </para>
    <para>
    The changes for NetBSD have been sent to him, and will
    hopefully be integrated soon.  To learn more about plex86, visit

<sect3 id="emul_lkm">
<title>12 Dec 2000 - Infrastructure to load emulations via LKM in NetBSD-current</title> 
<para>
    Jarom&iacute;r Dolecek has added an infrastructure to the kernel for
    loading emulations and support for executing emulation binaries via LKM.
    This means that e.g. Linux or FreeBSD compat code is now dynamically
    loadable and the support for running respective binaries can be added in
    runtime.
    </para>
    <para>
    The build infrastructure is there for all support emulations and
    compatibility exec formats under sys/lkm/{compat|exec}/*.  It has only
    been tested for Linux/ELF emulation on i386 so far.  Other LKMs are built,
    but not installed yet, since they haven't been tested.
    </para>
    <para>
    If you find any other compat or exec LKMs working, please use &man.send-pr.1;
    so that it gets enabled (or, if it's not working, so it can be fixed).

<title>30 Nov 2000 - Updated ncr53c9x driver</title>

    Eduardo Horvath has added TAG QUEUE support to the ncr53c9x driver in

<sect3 id="ubc-code">
<title>27 Nov 2000 - UBC code integrated into NetBSD-current</title> 
<para>
Chuck Silvers has integrated the Unified Buffer Cache project code into
NetBSD-current.  To build a new -current kernel from an
existing kernel configuration file, you'll want to remove any settings for
"BUFCACHE", "NBUF", or "BUFPAGES", and let the size of the buffer cache go
back to the default.  After that, you'll need to rerun <code>config</code>, and
then you can build away.
</para>
<para>
Under UBC, the traditional buffer cache is no longer used for storing regular
data, only metadata, so you'll want to allow the VM system to manage most of
your physical memory.  The default buffer cache size will be fine for most
people, regardless of the amount of memory in the machine.
</para>
<para>
What does this mean for you?  For most people, more memory will be available
for caching regular file data, so filesystem i/o will be faster since there
will be more times when the data you're accessing is already in memory.  How
much faster depends on what you're doing, but you'll probably notice the
difference.

<title>11 Sep 2000 - Change in kernel pty structures allocation</title> 
<para>
   Jarom&iacute;r Dolecek has changed the way pty structs are allocated in
   NetBSD-current.  It's now allocated at run-time, allowing support for
   an arbitrary number of ptys without the need of a kernel recompile.
</para>
   <para>
   The value was previously set in a kernel config via:
</para>
   <para>
   <programlisting>
   pseudo-device pty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<emphasis>foo</emphasis></programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
   This now does not mean that the fixed number <emphasis>foo</emphasis> is available, but
   rather how big is the array of pointers to pty structs on the start.  If
   <emphasis>foo</emphasis> is omitted, 64 is used.  This initial array is enlarged as
   necessary.
   </para>
   <para>
   Also, there's a new sysctl, kern.maxptys, which limits how many maximum
   pty's might exist.  This defaults to 512.  Note that one would need to
   install newer kernel includes and rebuild &man.sysctl.8; for it to
   support kern.maxptys.

<sect3 id="largepages">
<title>07 Sep 2000 - Initial support for large pages</title> 
<para>
    Jason Thorpe has added support for mapping the kernel text using large
    pages to NetBSD-current/i386.  This gives a reasonable performance
    improvement.  For example, building a GENERIC kernel on a 600MHz P-III
    laptop:
   </para>
<blockquote>
    <para>
    before: 636.59s real   387.34s user    27.53s system
   </para>
    <para>
    after: 597.21s real   382.88s user    24.88s system
   </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>
    Note that compiling stuff is userland-intensive, so things that spend a
    lot more time in the kernel (e.g forwarding packets, IPsec processing,
    RAIDframe, etc.) are likely to see better improvements.
   </para>
    <para>
    This is initial support for large pages, so there is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> generic
    support for using large pages for other types of mappings yet, nor is
    there support for mapping the kernel data/bss segments with large pages
    (although that should be pretty straightforward).

<sect3 id="mipsco">
<title>06 Sep 2000 - Port for MIPS Computer Systems Inc. family of workstations and servers</title> 
<para>
    In July, Wayne Knowles <email>wdk@NetBSD.org</email>, a researcher in New Zealand,
    successfully ported NetBSD to his RC3230 made by MIPS Computer Systems,
    Inc.  The RC3230 was a R3000A desktop box commonly called R3000 Magnum;
    a popular workstation that was re-badged by companies such as Bull and
    Olivetti.  The port name was decided to be NetBSD/mipsco so other computers
    by MIPS Computer Systems could be included in it.
   </para>
    <para>
    In early August, NetBSD/mipsco was merged into the main NetBSD tree, and
    has seen many improvements since.  Changes were committed to allow the
    kernel to read either a BSD disklabel created under NetBSD/sparc or a
    MIPS volume header created under Risc OS.  This change allowed the stand
    alone shell to directly load a NetBSD kernel and mount a filesystem -
    NetBSD/mipsco became self-sufficient.
   </para>

<title>20 Jun 2000 - NetBSD 1.5 release cycle started</title> 
<para>
    Today, the release cycle for NetBSD 1.5 has started. The NetBSD 1.5
    release is scheduled for early fall this year. Of course, we want
    this to be the best NetBSD release ever, as with every release.
    To help achieve this goal, you can test the ALPHA and BETA snapshots
    that will be made available, or track the release branch sources.
</para>
    <para>
    If you want to use the NetBSD 1.5 branch source code using anoncvs,
    update your source tree using the "-r netbsd-1-5" flag to the cvs
    "update" command, or check out a separate tree using this flag to
    the "checkout" command. To be sure that you get the 1.5 branch, you
    should always use the "-r netbsd-1-5" flag.
</para>
    <para>
    For people tracking -current using SUP: the -current sources on the
    NetBSD ftp and SUP servers will track the 1.5 release branch during
    the release cycle, so no extra action is required to get the 1.5
    branch sources.

    </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
    The Cyclades-Z is based on an MIPS R3000 which runs firmware provided by
    the driver.  The firmware handles all flow control, etc.  It also has
    optimizations for PPP (though the driver doesn't implement that yet).  The
    driver defaults to running in polled mode, polling the board every 20ms
    for input.  This is apparently the preferred method of running these
    boards, which is fine, since the board has a very large (4Kbyte) input
    buffer for each channel.

    This driver provides support for the newer Adaptec cards, most notably
    789x-based ones.  The option that the old driver had to enable tagged

<sect3 id="usacryptolaws">
<title>04 Feb 2000 - How the change in USA crypto export laws affects NetBSD</title>
<para>
    The core team's consensus decision on how NetBSD should react in light of
    the apparently changed crypto laws is as follows:
</para>
    <para>
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>Ensure that the said laws are in effect, and that NetBSD is permitted
    to export crypto and have USA developers work on foreign
crypto.</listitem>
    <listitem>Ensure that the appropriate paperwork is submitted to fulfill any
    requirements to permit the above to occur.</listitem>
    <listitem>Merge any salient code from crypto-us into crypto-intl, and maintain
    one code base for crypto in a repository which is off-shore from the
USA.</listitem>
    <listitem>Deprecate crypto-us</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
</para>
    <para>
    The rationale behind deprecating crypto-us would be due to the fact that
    USA developers would be allowed to work on foreign crypto source and
    re-export foreign crypto in source and binary.  Also, in the worst case
    scenario, if the USA government changes its stance to be less helpful,
    NetBSD would be better off.
</para>
    <para>
    This position is based on none of the above if it results in behaviour
    which is contrary to the new laws.

<para>
    The <ulink url="http://www.specialolympics2000.ca/">Canadian Special

    to provide connectivity, file storage, and backup.  At the main

    Internet dial service for up to 20 machines, as well as file
    storage and automated off-site backups from June 1999.  As the
    Games approached, several other NetBSD servers were set up on
    lan's at the various event venues to provide Internet service
    for event officials, the media, and the athletes.  These servers
    allow officials to post results to the web site immediately
    after the results are finalized, media to communicate stories
    and results to their offices, and athletes to send email back
    home and check out the results.
