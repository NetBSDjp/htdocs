<para>
    Ben Harris has modified the "<code>ne at podulebus</code>" driver to work
    around a bug in the MX98905 chip used on EtherI and EtherN cards, so they
    can now be used on NetBSD.  He has also tweaked the <code>vidcvideo</code>
    driver to find screen modes correctly on the ARM7500.  Between them, these
    allow an <code>NC_WSCONS</code> kernel to come up multi-user, with a proper

<title>19 Dec 2001 - NetBSD/amiga now has two-stage booter</title> 
<para>
    Michael L. Hitch has updated NetBSD/amiga <ulink
    url="../releases/current.html">-current</ulink> to have a two-stage booter.
</para>
    <para>
    The first stage is <code>bootxx_ffs</code> (for ffs boot partitions) or
    <code>bootxx_fd</code> (for bootable floppy disk).  These locate, load,
    and execute the second stage loader <code>boot.amiga</code>.  The console
    screen is created and passed to the second stage loader.
</para>
    <para>
    The second stage loader uses loadfile() to load the kernel image,
    which can be either <code>a.out</code> or <code>ELF</code> format, and can
    also be compressed (via &man.gzip.1;).  It will load a kernel file from
    <code>ffs</code> file systems or the <code>ustarfs</code> used on floppy disks.

    url="http://www.mckusick.com/">Kirk McKusick</ulink> to the
    softdep code. One of them is to correctly track the numbers
    of free blocks/inodes, taking the pending softdeps into account.
    For this, two new fields (previously spare ones) were added.
</para>
    <para>
    This means that if you're using the <code>FFS_EI</code> option, you should
    recompile and install &man.fsck.ffs.8; before booting a new kernel,
    in order to have these fields correctly swapped in the case
    of fsck repairing the superblock.
</para>
    <para>
    If the kernel mutters a little when it mounts filesystems for
    the first time with a new kernel, don't worry about it.  If it
    continues to do that, please <ulink
    url="../support/send-pr.html">file a problem report</ulink>.
</para>
    <para>
    Also, in an unrelated change to the fixes mentioned above, the

<title>09 Dec 2001 - MI kernel build machinery done</title> 
<para>
    Andrew Brown has finished rolling all ports over to the new MI
    kernel build machinery.
    </para>
    <para>
    Kernel makefiles are now mostly assignments to make variables that get
    digested by <code>sys/conf/Makefile.kern.inc</code>, which provides the glue
    that makes it into a kernel.  Redundancy is
    now gone from kernel makefiles, meaning that development drift of one
    kernel makefile (instead of over all) is no longer that much of a
    problem.  Additionally, new "features" for kernels and kernel
    builds can now be added, modified, or removed much more easily.
    </para>
    <para>
    Everyone should make sure their &man.config.8; is up to date (you should do
    this anyway).  It is also a good idea to rerun <code>config</code> for any
    <ulink url="../releases/current.html">-current</ulink> kernels you've been

<sect3 id="sysctl-uvm">
<title>08 Dec 2001 - New sysctl tunables for UVM page-replacement </title> 
<para>
    Chuck Silvers has committed changes to create three new sysctl tunables
    that enforce a maximum amount of memory used for the different types
    of page allocations (anonymous process memory, cached file data,
    and cached executable data).  He has also renamed some of the old sysctl
    tunables to have less obscure names.
    </para>
    <para>
    The old tunables are now named:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      vm.anonmin
      vm.filemin      (instead of vm.vnodemin)
      vm.execmin      (instead of vm.vtextmin)</programlisting>
    <para>
    The new tunables are: 
    </para>
<programlisting>
      vm.anonmax
      vm.filemax
      vm.execmax</programlisting>
    <para>
    The values for the new tunables are percentages of RAM, just like the
    old ones.  The "max" limits in this context are only enforced when there
    isn't enough memory to satisfy all requests, so the usage for a given
    type can exceed the maximum if there is no demand for the other types.
    </para>
    <para>
    More information can be found in Chuck's announcement in the <ulink

<sect3 id="irda">
<title>05 Dec 2001 - Initial IrDA support</title> 
<para>
        Lennart Augustsson has added initial support for IrDA
        communication to the kernel.  It presents IrDA frames to
        userland; the kernel has all the knowledge of how to talk to
        the actual hardware and presents a uniform interface to the
        userland protocol stack.
    </para>
        <para>
        More information can be found in <ulink

<sect3 id="pkgsysconfdir">
<title>03 Dec 2001 - Customizable Location of NetBSD Package Configuration files</title> 
<para>
	Johnny Lam has committed some changes to NetBSD 
	<ulink url="../docs/software/packages.html">pkgsrc</ulink> 
	to implement a variable <code>PKG_SYSCONFDIR</code> used to specify
	the location of configuration files for NetBSD packages. 
    </para>
	<para>
	The idea of this change is to cater for various tastes of the user
	community. For example, some people like to keep all of their
	configuration files in /etc. Some feel that all package files
	should reside in /usr/pkg, whilst others wish to share /usr/pkg between
	several machines. 
    </para>
	<para>
	The variable can be set in /etc/mk.conf so that future packages use the
	facility. Furthermore, the configuration file directory can be set on a 
	per-package basis. For example, setting
	<programlisting>
	PKG_SYSCONFDIR.apache=/etc/apache</programlisting>
	in /etc/mk.conf will 
	result in the Apache package using the directory /etc/apache to 
	hold its configuration files. 
    </para>
	<para>
	Naturally for this change to work across pkgsrc, relevant packages 
	need to be converted to use the new variable. This process has been 
	started.

<para>
    Manuel Bouyer has committed some final touches to NetBSD's ATAPI tape

    The driver has been tested with an
    OnStream ATAPI drive and has been reported to work with Seagate

<sect3 id="curses-011202">
<title>02 Dec 2001 - Updated curses in tree</title> 
<para>
    Brett Lymn has committed changes to curses in <ulink

    newterm and set_term functions.  The changes are quite extensive at a
    fundamental level.
    </para>
    <para>
    One thing to look out for is that you must update your <code>vi</code>
    source and recompile that after installing the new libcurses
    otherwise <code>vi</code> will fail.  This is NOT a bug with curses; this
    is a problem with <code>vi</code> stealing library function names in certain
    configurations.  In this case <code>vi</code> defines its own newterm if
    it has been told there is not one in libcurses.  I have committed the
    config file change for this to the <code>vi</code> sources so you should
    be ok.

<title>25 Sep 2001 - Digital signatures for binary packages</title> 
<para>
    Alistair Crooks has committed changes to &man.pkg.add.1;; adding the
    ability to verify the contents of a binary package by using
    digital signatures.  This has been accomplished by added a
    "<code>-s <emphasis>verification-type</emphasis></code>" command line
    argument to &man.pkg.add.1;.
</para>
    <para>
    The following verification types have been defined:
    <code>gpg</code> (pkgsrc/<filename 
    role="pkg">security/gnupg</filename>),
    <code>pgp5</code> (pkgsrc/<filename 
    role="pkg">security/pgp5</filename>),
    and <code>none</code>.  Callouts are made to the relevant
    programs to verify the contents of the binary package, and
    its provenance. You are then asked whether you want to
    proceed with the installation. The "<code>none</code>" verification
    type is the same as the existing behaviour, and is also the
    default - in which case, no verification of the binary package
    is done.
</para>
    <para>
    The verification type is passed onto recursive &man.pkg.add.1;
    invocations for dependent packages
</para>
    <para>
    At the moment, the ability to verify packages is limited to
    those which are not specified by URL; removing this restriction

<title>31 May 2001 - NetBSD/vax now runs multicpu</title> 
<para>
    Anders Magnusson got his VAX 8350 to use all three processors.
    From the testing done so far, the system works quite fine.  Most
    of the code is in the source tree already, the rest will undergo
    a bit more cleanup and polishing, and will then be committed to
    the development branch, NetBSD-current.
    </para>
    <para>

    The VAX 8350 system is probably the slowest multiprocessor system
    that NetBSD will ever support; each CPU does about 2VUPS (~2MIPS).
    Note that the 8350 normally only has two CPUs, the third one was
    plugged in for testing purpose.
    </para>

    It shouldn't be too hard to make NetBSD/vax running on some funnier
    machines, like the 8800, which has two 6VUPS KA88 CPUs, and the
    6000 series, which can take up to six CPUs with upto 32VUPS

<para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Update 06/01:</emphasis> Jason Thorpe, the NetBSD/algor port maintainer,
    has added support for the Algorithmics P-4032 board.  This new
    support is untested as Jason doesn't have a P-4032 yet.
</para>
    <para>
    Jason Thorpe has ported NetBSD to the <ulink

    The new port is called NetBSD/algor, and it currently supports the
    P-5064, which has a QED RM5xxx CPU soldered on.
</para>
    <para>
    There is some skeletal support for the P-4032 (an older board, which has
    an R4xxx CPU).  There are some placeholders for the P-6032, which is
    their newest board, but no real code yet (the P-6032 has a different PCI
    controller, the Algorithmics BONITO).
</para>
    <para>
    There are still some issues with the NetBSD/algor kernel (apparently
    softintr-related), but it works well-enough to self-host.
</para>
    <para>
    Thank you to <ulink url="http://www.allegronetworks.com/">Allegro Networks</ulink>

    <para>
    The release cycle started with a thorough testing period of the
    <code>netbsd-1-5</code> branch.  This was NetBSD 1.5.1_BETA; and so far
    it looks to have been successful.  During this period, the 1.5.1
    source tree did see some activity - as documentation was updated,
    a couple of bugs were fixed, and some drivers from the trunk (<ulink
    url="../releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink>) were pulled up
    to the <code>netbsd-1-5</code> branch.  A <ulink

    <para>
    What will happen now are 1.5.1_BETA2 snapshots.  This is to ensure

    no reason to believe otherwise, but better safe than sorry).  The

<sect3 id="sushi-additions">
<title>26 Apr 2001 - New menu structures for sushi</title> 
<para>
    Tim Rightnour has committed new <code>networking configuration</code> and
    <code>processes</code> menu structures to sushi.  In addition, a new
    <code>sysctl</code> form has been added to the existing <code>system
    menu</code> structure.
    </para>
    <para>
    Sushi is an interactive, menu-based program that is
    designed to aid the user or administrator with administrative
    and complex tasks on their machines.
    Sushi provides a menu of various functions that the user can perform on
    his or her machine.  Once the user selects a desired function, the
    function is either performed outright, or in most cases, the user is
    asked to fill in a simple form with required and optional information,
    which is then processed by sushi, and the action occurs.
    </para>
    <para>
    The new networking configuration menu structure allows sushi to do
    tasks like edit /etc/exports, modify NIC configuration, and setup
    YP/NIS.  The processes menu structure will allow starting /
    stopping / showing / restarting of things in /etc/rc.d.  The new
    sysctl form in the system menu structure allows a user to both set
    sysctl's interactively, and save them in /etc/sysctl.conf.
    </para>
    <para>
    People running a NetBSD system with sushi already installed can
    update their menu structures easily by running '<code>make install</code>'
    in '<code>sharesrc/share/sushi</code>'.  Of course if you do a '<code>make
    build</code>' or install a snapshot based on <ulink
    url="../releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink> sources
    past 2001-04-26, you'll get the updated menus also.

<title>25 Apr 2001 - Merge of thorpej_scsipi branch in NetBSD-current</title> 
<para>
    Manuel Bouyer has merged the <code>thorpej_scsipi</code> branch in <ulink
    url="../releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink>.  The
    <code>thorpej_scsipi</code> branch was created for a complete rewrite of
    the SCSI/ATAPI mid-layer.  After the merge today, that rewrite
    is now in NetBSD-current.   The following is an overview of the
    changes and features:
    </para>
    <para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>All xfers are queued in the mid-layer, rather than doing so in
	an ad-hoc fashion in individual adapter drivers.
</listitem>
      <listitem>Adapter/channel resource management in the mid-layer, avoids
	even trying to start running an xfer if the adapter/channel doesn't
	have the resources.
</listitem>
      <listitem>Better communication between the mid-layer and the adapters.
</listitem>
      <listitem>Asynchronous event notification mechanism from adapter to
	mid-layer and peripherals.
</listitem>
      <listitem>Better peripheral queue management: freeze/thaw, sorted requeueing
	during recovery, etc.
</listitem>
      <listitem>Clean separation of peripherals, adapters, and adapter channels
	(no more scsipi_link). 
</listitem>
      <listitem>Kernel thread for each scsipi_channel makes error recovery much
	easier (no more dealing with interrupt context when recovering from
	an error).
</listitem>
      <listitem>Mid-layer support for tagged queueing: commands can have the tag
	type set explicitly, tag IDs are allocated in the mid-layer (thus
	eliminating the need to use buggy tag ID allocation schemes in many
	adapter drivers).  
</listitem>
      <listitem>Support for QUEUE FULL and CHECK CONDITION status in mid-layer;
	the command will be requeued, or a REQUEST SENSE will be sent as
	appropriate.
</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
    The core scsipi is well tested, but a number of HBA drivers need
    testing. If you encounter any problems please report them with
    &man.send-pr.1; and they'll get handled as soon as possible.

<title>17 Apr 2001 - Improvements in pkgsrc</title> 
<para>
    Alistair Crooks has made some more structural changes to the

    Also, if applicable, the digests for any patches have been moved
    from <code>files/patch-sum</code> to <code>distinfo</code> also.
    </para>
    <para>
    These changes mean that, due to information being centralized in
    the <code>distinfo</code> file, there are a reduced number of files in

    no files/ subdirectory in packages now.  Also, you should see a

<title>12 Mar 2001 - Linux compatibility enabled for PowerPC ports</title> 
<para>
    Emmanuel Dreyfus has integrated the Linux
    compatibility feature for the NetBSD PowerPC ports (macppc, prep, bebox,
    ofppc, and amigappc). Linux compatibility on the PowerPC is still an
    experimental feature, but some real world applications such as Netscape
    Communicator already work. Now, it is time to crash test your favourite
    application and to report problems if you want the Linux compatibility
    to be really reliable.
</para>
    <para> 
    In order to enable Linux compatibility for NetBSD/PowerPC, you need to
    upgrade your kernel to NetBSD-current, rebuild it with the COMPAT_LINUX
    option, and install the emulators/linuxppc_lib package. More details are
    available at <ulink url="http://gizmo.minet.net:8080/emul_linux/">http://gizmo.minet.net:8080/emul_linux/</ulink>.

<para>
    Chuck Silvers has committed <ulink
    url="../docs/kernel/#ubc">UBC</ulink> memory usage-balancing code to
    NetBSD-current.  Chuck's log message was as follows:
</para>
    <para>
<blockquote>
    "Add UBC memory-usage balancing.  We track the number of pages in use for
    each of the basic types (anonymous data, executable image, cached files)
    and prevent the pagedaemon from reusing a given page if that would reduce
    the count of that type of page below a sysctl-setable minimum threshold.
    The thresholds are controlled via three new sysctl tunables:
    vm.anonmin, vm.vnodemin, and vm.vtextmin.  These tunables are the
    percentages of pageable memory reserved for each usage, and we do not
    allow the sum of the minimums to be more than 95% so that there's always
    some memory that can be reused."
    </blockquote>
</para>
    <para>
    This should fix a lot of the interactive performance problems that people
    have been reporting.  Hopefully the default settings for the new sysctl
    tunables will be reasonable for everyone, but if anyone finds that
    things are much better with different settings, please post about it
    to the <ulink url="../mailinglists/#tech-kern">tech-kern mailing list</ulink>.

    <listitem> Big5, used commonly in Hongkong</listitem>
    <listitem> UTF-2 and UTF-8</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
We already have support for singlebyte encodings, like ISO-8859-1 or KOI8-R.

<para>
Now we should be able to start attacking other work areas, like wide
character stdio functions (like fgetwc), wide character curses/regex
functions, other locale types like LC_TIME and LC_COLLATE, more
locale definition files, and so forth.

<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> To avoid code footprint bloat, we disabled multibyte
LC_CTYPE locale support for statically linked binaries.  Statically
linked binaries can still enjoy singlebyte LC_CTYPE locale support
(like "fr_FR.ISO8859-1").  In the future, when NetBSD supports
dlopen() from within statically linked binaries, we may be able to
support multibyte LC_CTYPE locale from statically linked binaries.

<title>05 Jan 2001 - SEGA Dreamcast port and mailing list</title> 
<para>
    In July, Saitoh Masanobu <email>msaitoh@NetBSD.org</email>, a developer in Japan,
    successfully booted the NetBSD kernel on his Dreamcast, a game console
    made by SEGA Corporation.  The port used was the NetBSD/evbsh3 port
    for evaluation boards using the Super-H processor family also used in
    the SEGA Dreamcast.  Although this port contained no code specific to
    the Dreamcast, the fact that the CPU contained builtin peripheral
    modules such as timers and serial ports meant that the generic code
    could still make a working system with a serial port console.
    </para>
    <para>
    The Dreamcast port has now been split from the NetBSD/evbsh3 port into
    a port in its own right.  This means that the work on support for
    Dreamcast-specific hardware can now begin.  The Dreamcast port can boot
    up in single-user mode from a ramdisk (and play Rogue!), but since the
    serial port is still the only supported hardware device, it is not yet
    very useful to end users.  Please see below for a current dmesg
    output.
    </para>
    <para>
    The NetBSD/dreamcast port has been made possible by the developers of
    NetBSD/sh3:

    If you're interested in keeping up-to-date on the progress of this port,

<title>04 Jan 2001 - Sushi, a user administration tool for NetBSD</title> 
<para>
    Tim Rightnour has written and imported sushi - an interactive, menu-based
    program that is designed to aid the user or administrator with
    administrative and complex tasks on their machines.
</para>
    <para>
    Sushi provides a menu of various functions that the user can perform on
    his or her machine.  Once the user selects a desired function, the
    function is either performed outright, or in most cases, the user is
    asked to fill in a simple form with required and optional information,
    which is then processed by sushi, and the action occurs.
</para>
    <para>
    The programming interface for sushi is very simple.  There are
    directories containing various files, such as menu indexes, or forms for
    the user to fill out.  These files are interpreted by sushi to generate
    the menus the user sees on his/her screen.  When the form is filled out
    by the user, the entries are passed as command-line arguments to a
    program, or script contained in one of the subdirectories.  In this way,
    it is possible to add new entries to the sushi menu structure, by simply
    adding a new menu item, form and script, the binary does not need to be
    recompiled to take advantage of this new menu.
</para>
    <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Update:</emphasis> People interested in trying sushi out on their machines
    will need to upgrade their machines to -current as of 01/06/2001 (or wait
    for the next -current snapshot).  A number of extensive changes in
    libcurses were made, as well as the addition of the CDK and libform
    supporting libraries.  The binary itself is installed into /usr/sbin, and
    the menu structures are installed into /usr/share/sushi.  The menu
    structures will be installed normally as part of a make build, out of
    the sharesrc CVS module.
</para>
    <para>
    If you do try out this development version of sushi, please send any
    problem reports via &man.send-pr.1;.  If you wish to develop menu items for
    sushi, these may be submitted via &man.send-pr.1; as well.

<title>04 Jan 2001 - Curses based forms library</title> 
<para>
    Brett Lymn has implemented the a curses base forms library which 
    forms part of the ETI suite of libraries (originally done by AT&amp;T).
    This library provides a terminal independent forms interface for
    character terminals.
