   <title>19 Sep 2008 - Video4Linux2 compatible interface and USB video capture support</title>

<para>
Patrick Mahoney, a computer science student and author of the Frameworks 
stop-motion frame capture program, recently coded device-independent video 
driver support and a USB video device driver for NetBSD as part of the 
<ulink url="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/uvc/">2008 Google Summer of Code</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
NetBSD developer, Jared D. McNeill, imported Mahoney's video(4), video(9), 
and uvideo(4) drivers. And McNeill also coded and imported the pseye(4) 
driver for the Sony PLAYSTATION(R) Eye USB webcam.
</para>

<para>
These provide a Video4Linux2 compatible capture interface. The video layer 
implements some of the Video4Linux2 API including read() and provides some 
ioctl's to set controls in a device-independent way similar the audio(9) 
interface. The uvideo driver is specifically for USB Video Class
devices and not just any random webcam.
(<ulink url="http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/USB_Video_Class_1_1.zip">Link to USB Video Class specification.</ulink>)
</para>

<para>
McNeill said many Video4Linux2 applications work, such as mplayer, vlc, 
ffmpeg, cheese (clone of apple's Photo Booth), ucview (simple capture 
application on the EeePC), gstreamer (media framework used by GNOME 
applications), and ekiga (SIP/IAX/NetMeeting compatible video conferencing 
tool). (McNeill also imported the pkgsrc/net/ekiga-devel package.)

    <title>31 Jul 2008 - Metadata journaling support added to FFS</title>

    <para>
      Simon Burge has just added metadata journaling to the FFS (fast file
      system) code to NetBSD-current.
    </para>
    <para>
      The journaling code, known as WAPBL - Write Ahead Physical Block Logging
      - was originally written by Darrin B. Jewell for <ulink
      url="http://www.wasabisystems.com/">Wasabi Systems, Inc.</ulink>,
      and was contributed by Wasabi to the NetBSD community earlier this year.
      Wasabi has been shipping WAPBL-enabled products since 2003.
    </para>
    <para>
      &a.simonb;, &a.oster;, &a.pooka;, and &a.ad; spent quite some
      time on integrating this code into NetBSD-current and enhancing it to
      allow automatic creation of the journal log area inside existing
      filesystems to ease conversion.
    </para>
    <para>
      They also did some performance benchmarks and WAPBL performs very close
      to soft-dependencies mounts, and only slightly slower than (unsafe) async
      mounts. In case of a crash or unexpected power loss however, the
      journaled file system will not need a lengthy file system check at boot
      time, but instead the kernel will replay the log within seconds. This
      allows faster crash recovery, less overall downtime and higher
      availability.
    </para>
    <para>
      Converting an existing system to use the log feature is as easy as
      updating (both kernel and userland), making sure the kernel option
      WAPBL is selected (this is the default for GENERIC kernels now), adding
      a <quote><code>log</code></quote> option to /etc/fstab and rebooting.
      Note that WAPBL is not compatible with soft-dependencies, so please
      ensure that you first remove the <quote><code>softdep</code></quote>
      option if present. See the wapbl(4) manual page for more information.
    </para>
    <para>
      The WAPBL feature will be available in the upcoming NetBSD 5.0 release.
    </para>
    <para>
      Many thanks to Wasabi Systems, Inc. for contributing this code, everyone
      that helped to integrate it and especially &a.simonb; for his work on
      the in-filesystem journal.

    <title>30 Jul 2008 - NetBSD achieves permanent charity status</title>

    <para>
      The NetBSD Foundation has been granted permanent 501(c)(3) charity status
      under United States law. The Foundation has been a 501(c)(3) charity
      <ulink url="2004.html#501c3">since 2004</ulink>, but previously
      the status was given under an advanced ruling period, i.e. it was

      <ulink url="http://bestpractices.cof.org/community/ViewStandard.cfm?itemNumber=901">170(b)(1)(A)(vi)</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
      To achieve the permanent "public charity" status, we needed to prove
      that we are publicly funded by going through the financial activity of
      the past 5 years and filing the necessary forms. &a.wennmach;, &a.martin;,
      and &a.christos; spent quite a few weekends going through all the numbers
      and completing the forms, and we are happy to report that the IRS accepted
      our paperwork.
    </para>

    <para>
      Being a public charity is important to us, as it means that
      we are eligible to receive employer matching donations, as well as to
      enjoy the most beneficial tax treatment.

solicit feedback before refining and submitting it.

flesh out your thoughts and hand in your application.

      NetBSD is an open source operating system project that depends on funding for its operation.
