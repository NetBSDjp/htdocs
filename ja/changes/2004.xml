<title>06 Jan 2004 - pkgsrc gets experimental <quote>pkgviews</quote></title>

<para>
The <ulink url="../docs/pkgsrc/">NetBSD Packages Collection</ulink> aka
pkgsrc now has support for an experimental new framework called <quote><ulink
url="http://cvsweb.NetBSD.org/bsdweb.cgi/~checkout~/pkgsrc/mk/buildlink3/README?rev=1.4&amp;content-type=text/plain">pkgviews</ulink></quote>.
This framework, finally allowing multiple versions of one package to co-exist
without conflicts (among other great features), was first proposed by Alistair
Crooks at <ulink url="../docs/software/pkgviews.pdf">EuroBSDCon 2002</ulink>
and has been integrated into pkgsrc by Johnny C. Lam, who just posted a <ulink
url="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/tech-pkg/2004/01/06/0004.html">User's
guide</ulink> to the tech-pkg MailingList.
