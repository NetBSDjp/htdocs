<title>14 Dec 1999 - RSAREF2 library buffer overruns fixed</title> 
<para>
Recently, there have been several buffer overruns discovered in
the RSAREF library.  Shortly after the bugtraq post reporting this
problem was released, the fix supplied in that post was added to
pkgsrc.
</para>
<para>
However, as the CERT advisory CA-99-15 states:
<blockquote>
   We believe the patch originally provided by Core SDI in their
   advisory may not be a complete fix to this particular problem.
</blockquote>
Correspondingly, the revised fix referenced by the advisory has
been applied to NetBSD's pkgsrc distribution and is present in
<filename role="pkg">security/rsaref</filename> version 2.0p3 and later. 
NetBSD users who
use packages depending on rsaref should fetch the most recent pkgsrc
bits as soon as practical and rebuild packages, including
<filename role="pkg">security/ssh</filename>, which depend on rsaref.
</para>
<para>
If '<emphasis role="bold"><code>pkg_info rsaref</code></emphasis>' returns no output,
'<code>rsaref-2.0p3</code>', or later, then you do not have the affected
pkgsrc version installed. If you do have the affected version,
'<emphasis role="bold"><code>pkg_info -R rsaref</code></emphasis>' will list potentially impacted
packages that should be reinstalled.

has brought Kirk McKusick's trickle sync + FFS soft update code into
the main tree. It has had some moderate to heavy testing over the

filesystem containing all his sources on his main NetBSD development
machine, and did not have a problem since fixing the last known
bug (2.5 weeks ago).

<sect3 id="pnp-bios">
<title>14 Nov 1999 - Plug-and-Play BIOS support</title> 
<para>
There is now code in NetBSD-current to make use of the Plug-and-Play
BIOS present in practically all PC compatibles manufactured in the
last couple of years.
</para>
<para>
The PnP BIOS provides device types and resource usage for hardware
on the mainboard.  (For reference, see <ulink
url="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/respec/pnpspecs.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/respec/pnpspecs.htm</ulink>)
This allows ISA devices with unusual wiring to be accessed properly,
and (potentially harmful) device probing can be avoided.  The PnP
BIOS support has been found most useful on laptops, where it seems
common that interrupts are wired in strange ways. It shouldn't do
any harm on other machines&mdash;you know there is that other operating
system which depends heavily on Plug-and-Pray. 
</para>
<para>
It is young code however, the PnP BIOSes are of varying quality,
and the specification is not clear in all details (and only partly
obeyed by BIOS vendors). So keep a working kernel around if you
play with this...
</para>
<para>
The NetBSD PnP BIOS support is implemented as a logical bus
named "pnpbios", it will be enabled by a line:
<programlisting>  pnpbios0 at mainbus0</programlisting>
in the kernel configuration file. For now, only a few device
attachments are implemented - see the comments in 
<ulink url="http://cvsweb.NetBSD.org/bsdweb.cgi//sys/arch/i386/conf/GENERIC?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">/sys/arch/i386/conf/GENERIC</ulink>

<ulink url="http://cvsweb.NetBSD.org/bsdweb.cgi//sys/arch/i386/pnpbios/?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">/sys/arch/i386/pnpbios/</ulink>
for details. The kernel option
<programlisting>  options PNPBIOSVERBOSE</programlisting>
causes all devices nodes to be reported in the boot log, and their
resource usage. To interpret the PnP IDs,
<ulink url="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/download/respec/devids.txt">
http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/download/respec/devids.txt</ulink> might be
of some help.  Have a look at devices with unusual resource usage
- these might be worth writing some attachment code.

<sect3 id="softdeps">
<title>19 Oct 1999 - FFS soft dependencies code available</title> 
<para>
Kirk McKusick's FFS soft updates/dependency code has been around for quite
a bit, and has been in an "almost ready" state for NetBSD for close
to 2 years now. Which is a big shame, we really need to get this
integrated.
</para>
<para>
So,  Frank van der Linden has put it on a branch in our CVS tree, for the
adventurous to use and debug.
</para>
<para>
Simple usage:
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Get the code. For example, using anoncvs and ssh, set CVS_RSH to
'ssh', and do:
<programlisting>
cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot co -r fvdl-softdep src-nocrypto</programlisting>
This will create a directory called "src" with all that you need
in it. This includes all of src/sys, and a few bits living in
sbin/. Frank did not tag the rest of the sources, so they will not
be checked out; they are not needed for testing (you can just
use the rest of -current for that).
</para>
<para>
If you want a complete tree, checking out the whole
"src-nocrypto" without "-r fvdl-softdep", and then
doing a cvs update using the -r flag of that tree
should work.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>Compile a kernel as you always would, in the checked out
tree.</listitem>
<listitem>Compile the userland utilities (fsck_ffs, tunefs, mount)
Note that these will grab the wrong &lt;sys/foo.h&gt; include
files if you compile them, it's easiest to add a line
<programlisting>
CPPFLAGS+=-I../../sys</programlisting>
...to the Makefiles.</listitem>
<listitem>You can remove "update" from /etc/rc.conf if you want
to do some more permanent testing, since it's no longer
needed with the "trickle sync" code that comes with
the softdep code.</listitem>
<listitem>Boot the new kernel.</listitem>
<listitem>Find a crash &amp; burn filesystem. Run the new tunefs binary on it as:
<programlisting>
tunefs -n enable /dev/rXdXX</programlisting></listitem>
<listitem>Mess around with the filesystem.</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
<para>
Note that there is a known bug currently, which makes unmounting filesystems
with soft dependencies, that have been used moderately, hang.
</para>
<para>
Frank advises against using this yet if you're not willing to deal with
hanging unmounts and possible other problems. However, he would really
appreciate it if people could test it. Even if it's just a new kernel
without any filesystems that use soft dependencies (this should be
a lot more stable).

Hypersparcs have a VIPT cache, which means that to flush a page from
the cache a virtual-to-physical translation is done to do the cache tag
comparison.  This will cause an entry to appear in the MMU's TLB.  So,
when removing or changing mappings, doing a cache flush after clearing
entries from the TLB may cause spurious TLB entries causing funny
effects in your programs.  Some pmap functions had the cache and TLB
flush operation in the wrong order.

<title>10 May 1999 - Pool allocator diagnostic helpers</title> 
<para>
I've made some changes to the pool allocator which will aid in tracking

    </para>
<para>
I've added a "show pool" command to DDB, which dumps fairly complete
information about a pool.  Two modifiers are available: /p (show page
headers) and /l (show log).
    </para>
<para>
Logging is now enabled on a per-pool basis, so if you only need to track
allocations and frees on the mclpool, you can do that by making a change to
the pool_init() call that passes PR_LOGGING.  You can enable logging on all
pools by using the kernel option POOL_DIAGNOSTIC.
    </para>
<para>
Pool logging now also works on pools that are not pool_create()'d, but
rather just pool_init()'d.  If the pool_init() call is made too early to use
malloc(), logging is disabled automatically.
    </para>
<para>
I've also changed the ABI somewhat; file and line indicators are now ALWAYS
passed to pool_get(), pool_put(), and pool_reclaim().  These are used to
perform reentrancy checking and logging.  Logging and reentrancy checking are
available if DIAGNOSTIC is defined.  The file and line info are always passed
for the benefit of LKMs, etc.

<title>05 May 1999 - COMPAT_OSF1 enhancements</title> 
<para>
In post-NetBSD 1.4-branch NetBSD-current, <ulink
url="../ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</ulink> has much improved
OSF/1 (a.k.a. Digital UNIX, a.k.a. Tru64 UNIX) emulation, including
support for dynamically linked binaries.
</para>
<para>
Of note, the following applications are known to work to the extent
that they have been tested:
</para>

(Java and Javascript even appear to work, in Navigator!)

I expect that earlier versions of those applications, for earlier
versions of the Digital UNIX (or DEC OSF/1) environment, will function
with little or no effort but (not having them 8-) I couldn't verify
that.

<para>
Once NetBSD-current reverts back to the 'trunk' of the development
sources (after 1.4 is released), this will be available to you all as
part of NetBSD-current.
</para>
<para>
If you're not interested in running NetBSD-current, and instead want
to run the upcoming NetBSD 1.4 release, I have prepared a set of
patches to the 1.4 sources which integrate the functionality into
NetBSD 1.4.  If you're interested in getting the patches and are
willing to provide me feedback about what you're testing with them and
how well it works, please send me e-mail.
