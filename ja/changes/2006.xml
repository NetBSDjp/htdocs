    <para>
      The NetBSD release engineering would like to announce that we
      have re-started the process of releasing NetBSD 4.0.  The process was
      originally started back in August 2006, with a goal of releasing by 
      December. Due to a big number of improvements on the NetBSD-current
      branch during several hackathons, it was decided to restart the
      NetBSD 4.0 release process, instead of identifying and pulling all
      those changes into the existing release branch, see 
    <ulink url="#netbsd-4-rebranch-anounced">our previous announcement</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The NetBSD 4.0 release branch "netbsd-4" has been re-branched now,
      and details on the release schedule as well as details on
      where to get binaries and sources of the NetBSD 4.0_BETA2 release
      and how <emphasis>you</emphasis> can help are available

    <para>
      Approximately thirty NetBSD developers and
      more than 140 NetBSD users joined in on the two days, paying
      particular attention to improving
      install documentation and
      ensure build stability. A <ulink

      is likely to be used in future hackathons.
      All in all, over 200 bugs have been worked on in those two days
      and while not all of the critical showstoppers could be fixed,
      valuable progress was made in identifying root causes.

NetBSD doesn't have an official Live CD as part of the project, but there
are several ones from 3rd parties. J&ouml;rg Braun from the german publisher
"Computer und Literaturverlag" (C&amp;L) has previously made a NetBSD Live! CD
which was available via the C&amp;L FreeX magazine. J&ouml;rg has now
updated his Live CD to this millennium's state of NetBSD, and released the
2007 Edition of his NetBSD Live! CD.
The CD is based on NetBSD 4.0_BETA/i386 and offers a full desktop
environment by using a compressed filesystem, which includes KDE, Abiword,
Dia, Inkscape, GIMP, Firefox, xmms and many more.
    </para>

    <para>
Please note that the CD was assembled the previous weekend, and that
some newssites prematurely announced this. As a result, some people
may have a file with the wrong checksum - the correct MD5 hash is
"22a7496a2bb37910aeb312d053755a2a". </para>

Thanks to J&ouml;rg Braun, Rosa Riebl all the folks at C&amp;L for their
longtime support of NetBSD, and also to Michael Schneider, Daniel
Sieger, Martin Laubach and Florian St&ouml;hr for their help in
translating the German-language README file into english.

commercial distribution requires a license from C&amp;L.

      The NetBSD release engineering team is planning to roll out the
      NetBSD 3.1 release in a few weeks. Prior to the final release,
      a few release candidates are planned. We encourage you to test
      these and report any bugs using the &man.send-pr.1; utility.

    <para>
      The first release candidate (3.1_RC1) is scheduled for
      August 21, followed by a second release candidate (3.1_RC2)
      on September 4. If no significant  problems arise, we plan to
      release  NetBSD 3.1 final on September 18, otherwise another release
      candidate will follow, delaying the release another two weeks.

    <para>CARP is the Common Address Redundancy Protocol, developed

    Its primary purpose is to allow multiple hosts on the same

    alternative to the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol and the
    Hot Standby Router Protocol.  CARP works by allowing a group
    of hosts on the same network segment (known as <quote>redundancy
    group</quote>) to share an IP address, and in the event that
    the master host suffers a failure, the IP will move to one of
    the backups hosts and the service will continue unaffected.</para>

  <title>22 Feb 2006 - NetBSD iSCSI Status and HOWTOs</title>

  <para>&a.agc; has recently added support for an iSCSI target to
    NetBSD, and written HOWTOs for using it.  iSCSI is specified
    in RFC 3720 and describes a method for encapsulating SCSI
    commands in TCP/IP to remotely access block-level storage.  In
    iSCSI, the party offering a SCSI device (the server) is called
    a <quote>target</quote>, and the party using that device (the
    client) is called an <quote>initiator</quote>, so the iSCSI
    target exports blocks to the iSCSI initiators.</para>
  <para>NetBSD's iSCSI implementation was developed from the original
    Intel code (BSD-licensed) and has been tested with version 1.06
    of the Microsoft initiator as well as with its own test harness;
    an iSCSI initiator for NetBSD is currently under development.</para>
