        Recently, Google announced that there will be another instance of
        their popular <ulink url="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of
        Code</ulink> program in 2009.
        The NetBSD Project has participated in this program as a mentoring
        organization since its conception in 2005 (see our results from
        <ulink url="../foundation/press/soc2008-summary.html">2008</ulink>,

        and hopes again to be fortunate enough to take part in this year's
        iteration.
      </para>
      <para>
        As part of our preparation for the Summer of Code 2009, we have

        and would like to invite all interested students to likewise begin
        their research and start discussions with the possible mentors as

      <title>02 Feb 2009 - Summer of Code 2008 Summary</title>
      <para>
        In previous years, the NetBSD Project released a formal summary
        soon after that year's Summer of Code project deadline.  In 2008,
        we neglected to do this, but since we feel that the students and
        mentors deserve the full recognition for their hard work, we have
        finally prepared a <ulink

        release</ulink> summarizing last year's project.
      </para>
      <para>
        We apologize for the delay in getting this published.
        On the bright side, publishing this followup several months after
        the formal end of the program allowed us to include the work that
        was done after the "pencil's down" date:  since then, six of the
        students have become full NetBSD developers with commit
        privileges, and a lot of the work has been imported into our main
        source tree.

   <title>19 Sep 2008 - Video4Linux2 compatible interface and USB video capture support</title>

<para>
Patrick Mahoney, a computer science student and author of the Frameworks 
stop-motion frame capture program, recently coded device-independent video 
driver support and a USB video device driver for NetBSD as part of the 
<ulink url="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/uvc/">2008 Google Summer of Code</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
NetBSD developer, Jared D. McNeill, imported Mahoney's video(4), video(9), 
and uvideo(4) drivers. And McNeill also coded and imported the pseye(4) 
driver for the Sony PLAYSTATION(R) Eye USB webcam.
</para>

<para>
These provide a Video4Linux2 compatible capture interface. The video layer 
implements some of the Video4Linux2 API including read() and provides some 
ioctl's to set controls in a device-independent way similar the audio(9) 
interface. The uvideo driver is specifically for USB Video Class
devices and not just any random webcam.
(<ulink url="http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/USB_Video_Class_1_1.zip">Link to USB Video Class specification.</ulink>)
</para>

<para>
McNeill said many Video4Linux2 applications work, such as mplayer, vlc, 
ffmpeg, cheese (clone of apple's Photo Booth), ucview (simple capture 
application on the EeePC), gstreamer (media framework used by GNOME 
applications), and ekiga (SIP/IAX/NetMeeting compatible video conferencing 
tool). (McNeill also imported the pkgsrc/net/ekiga-devel package.)

    <title>31 Jul 2008 - Metadata journaling support added to FFS</title>

    <para>
      Simon Burge has just added metadata journaling to the FFS (fast file
      system) code to NetBSD-current.
    </para>
    <para>
      The journaling code, known as WAPBL - Write Ahead Physical Block Logging
      - was originally written by Darrin B. Jewell for <ulink
      url="http://www.wasabisystems.com/">Wasabi Systems, Inc.</ulink>,
      and was contributed by Wasabi to the NetBSD community earlier this year.
      Wasabi has been shipping WAPBL-enabled products since 2003.
    </para>
    <para>
      &a.simonb;, &a.oster;, &a.pooka;, and &a.ad; spent quite some
      time on integrating this code into NetBSD-current and enhancing it to
      allow automatic creation of the journal log area inside existing
      filesystems to ease conversion.
    </para>
    <para>
      They also did some performance benchmarks and WAPBL performs very close
      to soft-dependencies mounts, and only slightly slower than (unsafe) async
      mounts. In case of a crash or unexpected power loss however, the
      journaled file system will not need a lengthy file system check at boot
      time, but instead the kernel will replay the log within seconds. This
      allows faster crash recovery, less overall downtime and higher
      availability.
    </para>
    <para>
      Converting an existing system to use the log feature is as easy as
      updating (both kernel and userland), making sure the kernel option
      WAPBL is selected (this is the default for GENERIC kernels now), adding
      a <quote><code>log</code></quote> option to /etc/fstab and rebooting.
      Note that WAPBL is not compatible with soft-dependencies, so please
      ensure that you first remove the <quote><code>softdep</code></quote>
      option if present. See the wapbl(4) manual page for more information.
    </para>
    <para>
      The WAPBL feature will be available in the upcoming NetBSD 5.0 release.
    </para>
    <para>
      Many thanks to Wasabi Systems, Inc. for contributing this code, everyone
      that helped to integrate it and especially &a.simonb; for his work on
      the in-filesystem journal.

    <para>
      The NetBSD Foundation has been granted permanent 501(c)(3) charity status

      <ulink url="2004.html#501c3">since 2004</ulink>, but previously

    </para>

    <para>
      To achieve the permanent "public charity" status, we needed to prove

      Being a public charity is important to us, as it means that
