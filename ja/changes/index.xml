  <title>02 Apr 2008 - Summer of Code student applications period extended</title>
  <para>
Google has extended the student applications period for this year's Summer
of Code until April 7th, 2008.  This means, it's not too late to submit
your proposal.  With the extra days, students have more time to get in touch
with a mentor, to discuss their proposal on one of our mailing lists and to
solicit feedback before refining and submitting it.
  </para>
  <para>
The NetBSD Project would also like to take this as an occasion to remind
everybody that students' own proposals not explicitly listed on the <ulink
url="../contrib/soc-projects.html">projects page</ulink> are equally
welcome.  If you have a great idea on how to make NetBSD better, just
flesh out your thoughts and hand in your application.
  </para>
  <para>
Due to the strong competition in the Summer of Code program, you may even
wish to submit a second proposal;  often we receive multiple proposals for
the same project and have a hard time choosing one student over the other
-- a second proposal of equal quality might increase your chances to be
accepted.

If you have any questions, please contact the appropriate mailing list or
see if some of your possible mentors are available on #netbsd-code on IRC
(freenode.net).

      NetBSD is an open source operating system project that depends on funding for its operation. A generous donation by Google has enabled us to fund development in the area of symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and a fundraising drive was started to extend this activity. The goal of $50,000US of the 2007 fundraising campaign was met thanks to a lot of support from companies, users, and our community as a whole.

    <title>24 Jan 2008 - Joachim Schueth: beating the Colossus code breaking machine</title>

    <para>
      Joachim Schueth has beaten a reconstruction of the famous 
      <emphasis>Colossus Mark II</emphasis> code breaking machine 
      in November 2007. 
      The Colossus computers were used in World War II to break the 
      German encrypted messages. Equipped with a NetBSD-powered 
      laptop and profound knowledge of cryptography and the Ada programming 
      language, Schueth has won the code breaking challenge. We talked with 
      him about the historical  and technical backgrounds of the Cipher Event 
      and the tools he has used -
