    <title>28 Dec 2009 - Website translations removed</title>
    <para>
       As announced by &a.jschauma; in this <ulink
       url="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-docs/2009/12/26/msg000125.html">posting
       to the netbsd-docs@ mailing list</ulink>, we regrettfully have had to
       remove the existing partial translations of our website.
       Providing accurate and up to date documentation to all our users is
       very important to the NetBSD Project.  Unfortunately it has become obvious
       that the project is lacking the manpower to create or keep translations
       of the website up to date.
    </para>
    <para>
       As we believe that providing outdated documentation may actually be more
       harmful than only providing English content, we have decided to no longer
       maintain non-English documentation in our ``htdocs'' repository or on our
       website.
       In the future, we encourage translations as a community effort, hosted
       off-site (ie not on the NetBSD Project's web server).  Please see
       <ulink url="../community/i18n.html">this page</ulink> for links to
       existing efforts.

     <title>25 Jul 2009 - GPIO Revisited</title>
     <para>
       NetBSD has had support for General Purpose Input/Output devices since the 4.0 release, when the GPIO framework was imported.
       GPIO devices, or gpios for short, provide an easy way to interface electronic circuits which can be as simple as a LED or that provide more complex functionality like a 1-Wire or I2C bus.
     </para>

     <para>
       Since the import of the GPIO framework into NetBSD, Marc Balmer has reworked larger parts of that subsystem to address some problems and drawbacks.
       They are now available in NetBSD where they will be further improved.
       The new GPIO framework retains backwards compatibility while adding new features: It integrates with the kauth(9) security framework, has its own config file format gpio.conf(5), and integrates with the system startup scripts in /etc/rc.d. 
     </para>

  <title>29 Apr 2009 - NetBSD 5.0 released!</title>
  <para>
    The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that NetBSD 5.0, the
    thirteenth release of the NetBSD operating system, is now available.
  </para>
  <para>
    NetBSD 5.0 features greatly improved performance and scalability on
    modern multiprocessor (SMP) and multi-core systems. Multi-threaded
    applications can now efficiently make use of more than one CPU or
    core, and system performance is much better under I/O and network load. 
  </para>
  <para>
    In addition to scalability and performance improvements, a significant
    number of major features have been added. Some highlights are: a preview
    of metadata journaling for FFS file systems (known as WAPBL), the
    jemalloc memory allocator, X.Org instead of XFree86 on a number of ports,
    the Power Management Framework, ACPI suspend/resume support on many
    laptops, write support for UDF file systems, the Automated Testing
    Framework, the Runnable Userspace Meta Program framework, Xen 3.3
    support for both i386 and amd64, POSIX message queues and asynchronous
    I/O, and many new hardware device drivers.  For all the details, see the
    <ulink url="../releases/formal-5/NetBSD-5.0.html">full release notes</ulink>.
  </para>
  <para>
    Andrew Doran has prepared a short presentation giving an overview of 
    the new features and performance improvements that 5.0 provides.

        their research and start discussions with the possible mentors as
        well as on our public mailing lists.

      <title>02 Feb 2009 - Summer of Code 2008 Summary</title>
      <para>
        In previous years, the NetBSD Project released a formal summary
        soon after that year's Summer of Code project deadline.  In 2008,
        we neglected to do this, but since we feel that the students and
        mentors deserve the full recognition for their hard work, we have
        finally prepared a <ulink
        url="../foundation/press/soc2008-summary.html">press
        release</ulink> summarizing last year's project.
      </para>
      <para>
        We apologize for the delay in getting this published.
        On the bright side, publishing this followup several months after
        the formal end of the program allowed us to include the work that
        was done after the "pencil's down" date:  since then, six of the
        students have become full NetBSD developers with commit
        privileges, and a lot of the work has been imported into our main
        source tree.
