Greg Oster has just added RAIDframe version 1.1 to the NetBSD kernel.

simulator and a device driver for a limited number of architectures.
The RAIDframe device driver in NetBSD-current is a full RAID
implementation, including levels 0, 1, 4, 5, hot spares, and more, and
is available for all NetBSD platforms.  The base code for RAID level 6,
parity logging, and a number of other features is present in the
driver, but requires additional testing and debugging.  For more

<sect3 id="gre">
<title>13 Sep 1998 - Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) implementation</title> 
<para>
This is a very alpha implementation of GRE packet encapsulation.
Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) is described in RFC 1701 and 1702.
The interface also supports IPIP (protocol 4) encapsulation,
as described in RFC 2003 but default is GRE mode.
</para>
<para>
Basically GRE allows to tunnel not only IP over IP, but also provides
for other protocols like Appletalk etc. Cisco routers do their multicast
tunnels over &man.gre.1;. The hope is, that with GRE encapsulation, a method
is found to encapsulate all other protocols with one mechanism and reduce
the need for own tunneling in ip_mroute etc.

<title>31 Aug 1998 - UVM improvements, plus i386 and arm32 switch</title> 
<para>
<ulink url="../ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386</ulink> and <ulink
url="../ports/arm32/">NetBSD/arm32</ulink> have switched over to
the new <ulink url="../docs/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</ulink> virtual
memory system.
</para>
<para>
Over the last few days, Jason Thorpe has been making some improvements
to the way UVM allocates some of its data structures. On the Alpha and
MIPS platforms, many UVM data structures are now mapped via the KSEG,
which will avoid TLB thrashing on these platforms.  On others, many
structures are now mapped via the kernel_map, instead of the kmem_map,
which means that the kmem_map is a lot less likely to suffer a resource
shortage.
</para>
<para>
These changes now make it possible for UVM to run on large memory x86
systems without additional tweaks to default parameters (a similar
problem existed to a lesser extent on mac68k systems, as well).
Because this problem is now fixed, I have switched the x86 port to use
UVM+PMAP_NEW by default.
