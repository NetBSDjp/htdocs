<!-- The NetBSD Foundation would like to announce its 2007 fundraising -->
<!-- campaign.  Thanks to donations from earlier this year, we were able to -->
<!-- <ulink url="../foundation/press/hiring-ad.html">fund a developer</ulink> -->
<!-- to work on NetBSD and we would like to extend that opportunity.  We are -->
<!-- aiming to raise $50,000 US by the end of the year.  Every donation, both -->
<!-- major and minor, is welcome and will be put to good use! -->
<!-- </para> -->
<!-- <para> -->
<!-- We will spend the money with a focus on improving NetBSD's SMP, real-time -->
<!-- computing and embedded capabilities.  This task requires a lot of work to -->
<!-- be done by the NetBSD developers, as well as the provision of the most -->
<!-- modern hardware.  Thus the main goals are: -->
<!-- <itemizedlist> -->
<!-- <listitem>provide necessary hardware for developers.</listitem> -->
<!-- <listitem>continue funding developers to work on improving NetBSD.</listitem> -->

<!-- <para> -->
<!-- We are inviting the NetBSD community and organizations using NetBSD to -->

<sect1 id="why">
<title id="why.title">Why donations are important</title>
<para>
The NetBSD Foundation is a non-profit organization that produces open
source software, and has Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) status.
This means that it has no regular source of income, instead it is
relying on generous donations from third parties.
</para>

<para>
Funding for the NetBSD Foundation comes from a variety of sources.
Organizations and individuals interested in NetBSD contribute money,
hardware and rack space to support important NetBSD Foundation services,
and to enable developers to support new hardware platforms and peripherals.
</para>

<para>
It's important to understand that every donation matters. Without servers
and rack space at colocation facilities, we would not be able to provide
high-quality services such as regular builds and the various web and
FTP services to our developers and users. Without donations of development
hardware, we would not be able to support the huge range of
<ulink url="../ports/">platforms</ulink> and
<ulink url="../support/hardware/">peripherals</ulink> we do today. Promotional work
at events enables us to present our work to others and acquire new
developers and users. Each of these functions is important to the ongoing
health of the NetBSD Foundation.
</para>

<para>
So, whether you're a Fortune 100 company shipping NetBSD in a product, a
company running your web server on NetBSD, a home user with NetBSD on your
desktop, or just someone who thinks NetBSD is cool &#8212; or all four
&#8212; please consider donating something to the NetBSD Foundation.
</para>

<para>
There are, of course, other ways that both <ulink
url="../contrib/">individuals and
organizations</ulink> can contribute to
The NetBSD Foundation.

<sect1 id="how-to-donate">
<title id="how-to-donate.title">Making a donation to The NetBSD Foundation</title>
<para>
The simplest way to donate is monetarily, via PayPal. To donate using PayPal,
start here:
<html:form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">
<html:input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_xclick"/>
<html:input type="hidden" name="business" value="paypal@NetBSD.org"/>
<html:input type="hidden" name="item_name" value="The NetBSD Foundation"/>
<html:input type="hidden" name="no_shipping" value="1"/>
<html:input type="hidden" name="return" value="http://www.NetBSD.org/"/>
<html:input type="hidden" name="cancel_return" value="http://www.NetBSD.org/"/>
<html:input type="image" src="../images/links/paypal.gif" name="submit" alt="Donate using PayPal"/>
</html:form>
You do not need to have a PayPal account to send money to NetBSD.  You can use
a credit card on PayPal's site to send funds directly to the NetBSD PayPal
account, or you can use funds from your own PayPal account if you have one.
The PayPal address for NetBSD is <email>paypal@NetBSD.org</email>.
</para>

<para>
If you would prefer not to use PayPal, you can mail a cheque or do a bank
transfer.  Please contact <email>finance-exec@NetBSD.org</email> for address
and account details.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis role="bold">All donations to the NetBSD Foundation are fully
   tax-deductible in the US!</emphasis>
</para>

<sect2 id="link-policy">
<title id="link-policy.title">Donation Policy</title>

<para>
The NetBSD Foundation has a policy of acknowledging donors on their
web pages (see below). After we received your donation, we will
send you an acknowledgement letter, containing a confirmation section
for the IRS and a small questionnaire about how you wish your entry
to appear on the donor web pages.
</para>

<para>
Please note that as of 2007-03-15, links to donor URLs will be put up
only for donations that exceed $50.00 USD. Normally the link to the donor
URL will be established after a delay of one month.
</para>

<para>
If you have any questions about the donation process or if you want or
don't want your name to be added to the <ulink url="2008.html">list of
contributors</ulink>, please let us know at
<email>finance-exec@NetBSD.org</email>.
