<para>
A project has no point if it doesn't have goals.  Thankfully,
the NetBSD Project has enough goals to keep it busy for quite some
time.  Generally speaking, the NetBSD Project:

<para>
  Some more technical ideas about where we would like to take NetBSD over
  the next N years are described in our <ulink

</para>

<para>
In summary:
<blockquote>The NetBSD Project provides a freely available and
redistributable system that professionals, hobbyists, and
researchers can use in whatever manner they wish.</blockquote>
</para>

<para>
People often ask for a list of differences between NetBSD and other

explain the goals and philosophy behind other projects here - we
suggest you check each site for their goals, and make your own decision.
