<title>What is the NetBSD Project?</title>

<para>
The NetBSD Project is an international collaborative effort of a
<ulink url="../people/">large group of people</ulink>, to produce a
<ulink url="../about/redistribution.html">freely
available and redistributable</ulink>
<ulink url="call-it-a-duck.html">UNIX-like</ulink> operating system,
<emphasis role="bold">NetBSD</emphasis>.
In addition to our own work,
NetBSD contains a variety of other free software, including
<emphasis role="bold">4.4BSD Lite</emphasis> from the
<emphasis role="bold">University of California, Berkeley</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
One of the primary focuses of the NetBSD project has been to make the
base OS
<ulink url="../about/portability.html">highly portable</ulink>.  This has
resulted in NetBSD being ported to a large number of
<ulink url="../ports/">hardware platforms</ulink>.  NetBSD is also
<ulink url="../about/interop.html">interoperable</ulink>, implementing
many standard APIs and network protocols, and emulating many other systems'
ABIs.
</para>

<para>
NetBSD is distributed in three forms:
<ulink url="../releases/formal.html">formal releases</ulink>,
<ulink url="../releases/release-map.html#maintenance">maintenance branches</ulink>, and
<ulink url="../releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink>.
Formal releases are done periodically and include well-tested
binaries, source code, and installation tools.  Maintenance branches
usually provide bug and security fixes and minor enhancements.
NetBSD-current is a nightly distribution
of the latest development sources, meant for people who want the
absolute latest software, and don't mind an occasional bug.
</para>

<para>
NetBSD is largely supported by users, via Usenet newsgroups,
<ulink url="../mailinglists/">mailing lists</ulink>, and
<ulink url="../contrib/">direct contributions</ulink>.
If you're having a problem, it's likely that someone will have seen it
before and will be able to help you.
</para>

<para>
The <ulink url="../foundation/">NetBSD(tm) Foundation</ulink>
is a tax exempt, not-for-profit 501(c)3 corporation, that
devotes itself to the traditional goals and Spirit
of the NetBSD Project and owns the trademark of the word
<quote>NetBSD</quote>.

  <title>The NetBSD Project's goals</title>
  
  <para>
    A project has no point if it doesn't have goals.  Thankfully,
    the NetBSD Project has enough goals to keep it busy for quite some
    time.  Generally speaking, the NetBSD Project:
  </para>

  <para>
    Some more technical ideas about where we would like to take NetBSD over
    the next N years are described in our 
    <ulink url="roadmap.html">roadmap</ulink>.
  </para>
  
  <para><emphasis role="bold">In summary:</emphasis>
      The NetBSD Project provides a freely available and
      redistributable system that professionals, hobbyists, and
      researchers can use in whatever manner they wish.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    People often ask for a list of differences between NetBSD and other
    freely available unix systems. It would not be appropriate to try to
    explain the goals and philosophy behind other projects here - we
    suggest you check each site for their goals, and make your own decision.

<sect2 id="name">
<title>Why the name?</title>

<para>
The <quote>BSD</quote> in our name is an obvious recognition of our
heritage as a derivative of <emphasis role="bold">4.4BSD</emphasis>
and <emphasis role="bold">386BSD</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Our contributors communicate primarily via email and Internet-based
chat systems; many of us have never met each other in person.  We also
use a remote source code management system called <ulink
url="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</ulink> which enables a large number
of developers to do independent work on the same source tree easily.
We believe that the Internet was an enabling technology that made
NetBSD possible.  The <quote>Net</quote> in our name was thus chosen
as a tribute to the Internet.

<sect2 id="people">
  <title>The people who make NetBSD happen</title>
  
  <para>
    A large number of people have put a lot of time and effort into making
    the NetBSD operating system what it is today, either by developing the
    system itself, supporting its development, or simply using it.
    Those people can be broken down into the following groups:
  </para>

    <listitem>
      <ulink url="../people/developers.html"><emphasis role="strong">NetBSD
          Developers</emphasis></ulink>

      <ulink url="../people/core.html">The NetBSD Core Group</ulink>

    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>
    Additionally, without the University of California, Berkeley's
    <ulink url="../people/CSRG-contrib.html">Computer Systems Research Group and the
      many contributors to the Berkeley Software Distributions</ulink>,
    the NetBSD Project surely would not exist.  We thank them for
    their efforts.
