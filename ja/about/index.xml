<title>What is the NetBSD Project?</title>

<para>
The NetBSD Project is an international collaborative effort of a
<ulink url="../people/">large group of people</ulink>, to produce a
<ulink url="../about/redistribution.html">freely
available and redistributable</ulink>
<ulink url="call-it-a-duck.html">UNIX-like</ulink> operating system,
<emphasis role="bold">NetBSD</emphasis>.
In addition to our own work,
NetBSD contains a variety of other free software, including
<emphasis role="bold">4.4BSD Lite</emphasis> from the
<emphasis role="bold">University of California, Berkeley</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
For more information, see the <ulink url="features.html">NetBSD features page</ulink>,
some <ulink url="../gallery/in-Action/">screenshots</ulink> 
or go directly to the 
<ulink url="../releases/">download</ulink> section if you're impatient.
</para>

<para>
One of the primary focuses of the NetBSD project has been to make the
base OS
<ulink url="../about/portability.html">extremely portable</ulink>.  This has
resulted in NetBSD being ported to a large number of
<ulink url="../ports/">hardware platforms</ulink>.  NetBSD is also
<ulink url="../about/interop.html">highly interoperable</ulink>, implementing
many standard APIs and network protocols, and emulating many other systems'
ABIs.
</para>

<para>
NetBSD is distributed in three forms:
<ulink url="../releases/formal.html">formal releases</ulink>,
<ulink url="../releases/release-map.html#maintenance">maintenance branches</ulink>, and
<ulink url="../releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</ulink>.
Formal releases are done periodically and include well-tested
binaries, source code, and installation tools.  Maintenance branches
usually provide bug and security fixes and minor enhancements.
NetBSD-current is a nightly distribution
of the latest development sources, meant for people who want the
absolute latest software, and don't mind an occasional bug.
</para>

<para>
NetBSD is largely supported by users, via Usenet newsgroups,
<ulink url="../mailinglists/">mailing lists</ulink>, and
<ulink url="../contrib/">direct contributions</ulink>.
If you're having a problem, it's likely that someone will have seen it
before and will be able to help you.
</para>

<para>
The <ulink url="../foundation/">NetBSD(tm) Foundation</ulink>
is a tax exempt, not-for-profit 501(c)3 corporation, that
devotes itself to the traditional goals and Spirit
of the NetBSD Project and owns the trademark of the word
<quote>NetBSD</quote>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="name">
<title>Why the name?</title>

<para>
The <quote>BSD</quote> in our name is an obvious recognition of our
heritage as a derivative of <emphasis role="bold">4.4BSD</emphasis>
and <emphasis role="bold">386BSD</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Our contributors communicate primarily via email and Internet-based
chat systems; many of us have never met each other in person.  We also
use a remote source code management system called <ulink
url="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</ulink> which enables a large number
of developers to do independent work on the same source tree easily.
We believe that the Internet was an enabling technology that made
NetBSD possible.  The <quote>Net</quote> in our name was thus chosen
as a tribute to the Internet.
