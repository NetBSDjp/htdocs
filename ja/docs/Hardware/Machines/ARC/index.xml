      Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) Specification for the
      Advanced Computing Environment (ACE)
    </title>
    <para>
      The Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) consortium was
      set up in the early 1990's by a number of companies to try
      and make a commodity computing platform based on <ulink
      url="http://www.mips.com/">MIPS</ulink>
      processors as an alternative to the <ulink
      url="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</ulink>-compatible Personal
      Computer based on <ulink
      url="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</ulink> or <ulink
      url="http://www.amd.com/">Intel-compatible</ulink>
      processors.  </para><para> The ACE consortium produced the
      <ulink url="riscspec.pdf">Advanced RISC Computing (ARC)
      Specification</ulink> (393K bytes, PDF), to specify
      hardware and firmware standards for this new computing
      platform.
    </para>

    <para>
      Unfortunately, the ARC platform failed to gain a
      critical mass of interest, and <ulink
      url="http://www.byte.com/art/9606/sec5/art1.htm">the
      consortium fell apart</ulink>. The effort wasn't
      completely wasted; <ulink
      url="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</ulink> was a
      member of the consortium and adopted much of the ARC
      specification for Windows NT, though Microsoft
      discontinued support for MIPS processors with the release
      of Windows NT version 4.
    </para>

    <para>
      The NetBSD Project supports these systems in <ulink
      url="/Ports/arc/">NetBSD/arc</ulink>.  We make <ulink
      url="riscspec.pdf">version 1.2 of the ARC
      specification</ulink> (393K bytes, PDF) available with
      MIPS's permission, provided that we make clear that this
      is a historical document which the modern, post-<ulink
      url="http://www.sgi.com/">SGI</ulink> MIPS does
      in no way support.
