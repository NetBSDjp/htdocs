  <para>
    Using NetBSD/prep as a base, NetBSD was ported to an MVME1603-051 by
    <ulink url="mailto:scw@NetBSD.org">Steve Woodford</ulink>. The board was one
    of two donated to the NetBSD Foundation by Gan Starling on the condition
    that a port be attempted.
  </para>

  <para>
    Following receipt of the boards, and replacement of the VxWorks bootcode
    by a PPCBUG image kindly provided by Motorola Computer Group,
    NetBSD/mvmeppc was up and running multi-user within two weeks.
