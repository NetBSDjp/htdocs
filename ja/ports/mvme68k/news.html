<dt><b>2001-08-12:</b> NetBSD/mvme68k now using MI mk48txx TOD-chip driver
    <dd>Steve Woodford has split the nvram/rtc functionality away from
    the clock interrupt code in NetBSD/mvme68k -current.  It now attaches
    to mainbus0 as `timekeeper0 at mainbus0'.  Additionally, MI mk48txx
    nvram/rtc access functions are now being used.
    <p>
    It should now be very easy to add a character device for the benefit
    of userland access to NVRAM.
    <p>

<dt><b>2001-08-09:</b> Support for MVME177 completed, new snapshot
    <dd>Thanks to a donation of a <a
    href="http://mcg.motorola.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=955&amp;ProductID=5&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME177</a>
    to the NetBSD Foundation by Matt Thomas, Steve Woodford has been able
    to complete the support for this m68060-based board in NetBSD/mvme68k
    -current.
    <p>
    Accordingly, Steve has made available a new NetBSD/mvme68k snapshot,
    based on 2001-08-07 -current sources.  It is available in the NetBSD/mvme68k
    <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/mvme68k/snapshot/">snapshot
    area of the ftp server</a>.
    <p>
    Since the last -current snapshot, a number of notable changes have made
    it into the NetBSD/mvme68k kernel:
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>The MI evcnt(9) interface is now used to record interrupt statistics.
        <p>
      <li>The standalone netboot program now supports DHCP in addition to
        rarp/bootparams.
        <p>
      <li>`Simulated' software interrupts have been replaced by real `hardware
        assisted' software interrupts. This reduces the amount of overhead
        on exit from exception handlers.
        <p>
      <li>Numerous pmap tweaks to improve reliability.
        <p>
      <li>The ECC DRAM controller(s) on MVME167/MVME177 (and optional on
        MVME162/MVME172) are now fully enabled. The kernel will now detect
        and log any errors reported by the controllers. You may need to change
        your kernel config files, as the memc(4) driver now attaches at mainbus0
        instead of pcctwo0. Note that the memc(4) driver does not yet support
        the MEMC040 parity checking memory controllers found on some boards.
        <p>
      <li>And, of course, completed MVME177 support.
    </ol>
    <p>
    As usual, if you experience any problems, please report them using
    send-pr(1) and/or the <a

<dt><b>2001-07-27:</b> Improved memory controller driver
    <dd>Steve Woodford, the NetBSD/mvme68k port maintainer, has improved
    the memory controller driver in NetBSD/mvme68k -current.
    The main benefit is that enabling, detecting and logging of DRAM
    ECC errors is now possible.
    <p>
    See the memc(4) man page for more details.

    <dd>NetBSD/mvme68k is now using the MI driver for 53c710 SCSI
    controller recently committed by Izumi Tsutsui.  If you're
    tracking -current on NetBSD/mvme68k and have you own custom
    kernel config files for mvme1[67][27] (i.e. all models except
    mvme147), you'll need to replace any reference to `ncrsc' (the
    old driver) with `osiop' (the new MI driver).

<dt><b>2000-08-21:</b> Support for MI VMEbus Drivers Extended!
    <dd>The MI VMEbus driver support added earlier this year has been
    extended to encompass VMEbus slave mode. This means that not only
    can MVME147 and MVME167 boards access slave boards over the VMEbus,
    but other VMEbus master boards can access memory reserved for this
    purpose on the MVME147 and MVME167. This is especially useful for
    VMEbus boards which can perform DMA transfers directly into host
    memory. Work is still ongoing to fully complete this feature, but
    it is functional enough to be useful right now.
