<sect1 role="toc" id="hpcmips-faq">

<sect2 id="booting">
<title>Booting</title>

<sect3 id="auto-start">
<title>Is there any way to automatically start an application on Compact
Flash under Windows CE?</title>
<para>
The current status is that we have no idea.  If you have any ideas,
working code is welcome.
</para>

<sect3 id="input-device">
<title>How does one give input to a Palm-sized PC with no keyboard?</title>
<para>
You can connect vt100 to serial connector, and on machines that run X
you can use on-screen keyboards.

<sect3 id="use-microdrive">
<title>Can I use an IBM microdrive?</title>
<para>
Yes.  If your machine supports IBM microdrive in WinCE, it will work fine.
On the IBM z50, the IBM microdrive and PCMCIA TypeIII hard drive are
supported, but beware, they significantly reduce battery life.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="hpcmips-apm">
<title>Does H/PC hardware have APM hardware?</title>
<para>
There is no such thing as APM hardware.  APM is a BIOS spec only.
The Vr41xx CPUs support a course battery level only (very low, which 
is really good).  There's nothing like a battery percentage in the hardware,
unless it is an addon doo-dad.  
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="z50-lcd">
<title>Is a test snapshot with the IBM z50 LCD suspend available anywhere?</title>
<para>
In the -current sources.
If you want to use test code, build a kernel with ITE8181_LCD_CONTROL_ENABLE
or change the ite8181_lcd_control_disable variable to 0 with gdb.
For more information see src/sys/arch/hpcmips/dev/ite8181.c.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="mobilepro-usb">
<title>Does USB work on the MobilePro 8xx machines?</title>
<para>
Yes. Some umass devices have strange errors, but most devices work
correctly.  Note that the USB port on these machines can only supply a
max of ~500mA, so an externally powered USB hub is highly recommended.
</para>
