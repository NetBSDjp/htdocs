<sect3 id="ec-nfs">
<title>NFS client with a 3Com 3c400 (<code>ec</code>) card</title>

<para>The 3Com 3c400 (<code>ec</code>) Multibus Ethernet card can only
buffer two received Ethernet packets, regardless of their length,
before it starts dropping packets.  Unless overridden, an NFS client
read requests 8 kilobytes at a time.  This means six or more packets
will be sent by the server, usually quickly enough to fill the card
and cause the third and subsequent packets to get dropped.</para>

<para>NFS has an all-or-nothing mentality about it, so the client will
throw away any packets it did get and just send the request again,
making for a vicious cycle.  The solution is to tell NFS to only
request 1 kilobyte at a time, done by adding an option to the client's
mount command:</para>

<title>History of NetBSD/sun2</title>
<para>
The sun2 port of NetBSD was started by Matt Fredette in January 2001.
He began working with <ulink url="../sun3/">NetBSD/sun3</ulink> from the 1.5 
release and after a few months had it booting multiuser.  In April
2001 he began merging the port into the NetBSD tree.</para>
