    Sony has good pages about it's history in both 
    <ulink url="http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/SonyHistory/">Japanese</ulink> and

    <ulink url="http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/SonyHistory/2-12.html#block3">Japanese</ulink> and
    <ulink url="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/SonyHistory/2-12.html#block3">English</ulink>.
    (Note "MIPS" in this article stands for

    According to that page, the first NEWS
    machine appeared in January 1987, in Japan.
    It was NWS-800, which is not supported by NetBSD/news68k as of this writing.
    It was designed for replacement of VAX mini-computers on desktop.
    The price was 950,000-2,750,000 Yen ($8800-$25000 US) and they were selling
    very well in Japan. The NEWS machines were used for DTP, CAD/CAM etc.
    They were sold in USA and Europe (there are a few user of
    NetBSD/news68k in USA and Italy) but the sales were
    hard because Sun Microsystems already had big market share.
  </para>

  <para>
    Sony released the newer MIPS based NEWS (NWS-3800) in December 1989,
    and they were used for VOD system and internet server etc.
    Note that the 4.4BSD/Lite release also supported the news3400 models.
    Finally the NEWS division in Sony has been dissolved in 1998.
