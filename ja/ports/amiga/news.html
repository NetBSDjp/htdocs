<dt><b>2001-12-19:</b> NetBSD/amiga now has two-stage booter
    <dd>Michael L. Hitch has updated NetBSD/amiga -current to have a
    two-stage booter.
    <p>
    The first stage is <tt>bootxx_ffs</tt> (for ffs boot partitions) or
    <tt>bootxx_fd</tt> (for bootable floppy disk).  These locate, load,
    and execute the second stage loader <tt>boot.amiga</tt>.  The console
    screen is created and passed to the second stage loader.
    <p>
    The second stage loader uses loadfile() to load the kernel image,
    which can be either <tt>a.out</tt> or <tt>ELF</tt> format, and can
    also be compressed (via gzip(1)).  It will load a kernel file from
    <tt>ffs</tt> file systems or the <tt>ustarfs</tt> used on floppy disks.

<dt><b>2001-10-06:</b> file(1) recognizes Amiga icons
    <dd>The file(1) command in NetBSD-current has been taught to recognize
    Amiga Workbench icon (.info) files and their basic types. This is not
    a NetBSD/amiga specific, but NetBSD/amiga users will most likely make
    use of this.
    This change is scheduled to be in the NetBSD-1.6 release, and will
    furthermore be available in the generic file for Unix distribution
    maintained by Christos Zoulas.
