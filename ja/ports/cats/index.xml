    <portnewsitem date="2002-09-13" title="New firmware for cats">
      Simtec have released new firmware for cats, I recommend that
      people install it.  It's been noted that it has fixed an issue
      relating to X on for at least one person.  The new firmware can
      be found on <ulink url="http://www.simtec.co.uk/">Simtec's
      website</ulink>, specifically their <ulink
      url="http://www.simtec.co.uk/products/EB110ATX/resources.html">cats
      support page</ulink>.  I would strongly recommend that cats
      users upgrade to 1.3, as the firmware allows for larger kernels,
      which means I'll be reenabling some devices in the -current
      INSTALL kernel.
    </portnewsitem>

    <portnewsitem date="2002-08-19" title="X support for cats">
      NetBSD/cats now has in-tree support for xfree86 4.2.0.  Sets are
      available for 1.6 RC1 from ftp.NetBSD.org in
      pub/NetBSD/arch/cats/xsets.  Anyone wishing to try to build X
      needs to update to the latest xsrc.  Note that you need 1.6BETA
      or 1.6 -current as the server uses the /dev/pci0 interface.
      Non-current users will need to add USE_XF86_4=YES to their
      /etc/mk.conf.  Note, I'll be requesting pullups to the
      netbsd-1-6 branch, but they may not make it into 1.6.
    </portnewsitem>

    <portnewsitem date="2001-07-29" title="Cats now has a mailing list">
      NetBSD/cats now has its own mailing list, port-cats.  The list
      is for discussion of both cats and EBSA boards and issues
      relating to them.  Generic arm issues should still to to the
      port-arm list.  To subscribe use the links on the side.
    </portnewsitem>

    <portnewsitem date="2001-06-10" title="Cats moves to its own arch dir">
      NetBSD/cats is now in its own arch dir, <ulink
      url="http://cvsweb.NetBSD.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sys/arch/cats/">sys/arch/cats</ulink>.
      Kernels should be built from there.  Note that GENERIC has grown
      as it now contains all the currently supported USB devices.  Any
      cats specific bugs should be reported using the newly created
      port-cats category in send-pr.
