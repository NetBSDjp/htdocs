   <para>
    NetBSD/amd64 is a port to the AMD64 family of processors and
    supports all other CPUs that implement the 64bit AMD64
    architecture.  These currently include AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon64,
    and Intel CPUs with the EM64T extension.
   </para>
   <para>
    NetBSD/amd64 is a true 64bit operating system. Running
    32bit NetBSD/i386 binaries is supported as well, see 
    &man.compat.netbsd32.8;. Running 32bit Linux emulations will
    be available in the future, the setup will be similar to
    the one described in &man.compat.svr4.32.8;.
   </para>
   <para>
    The port was first committed to the NetBSD source tree as NetBSD/x86_64
    on June 19th, 2001 and  renamed to NetBSD/amd64 on April 26th, 2003.
    </para>
    <para>
    The original work to do this port was done by Frank van der Linden at
    <ulink url="http://www.wasabisystems.com/">Wasabi Systems</ulink>, assisted by
    <ulink url="http://www.amd.com/">AMD</ulink>, who provided the simulator
    (Simics VirtuHammer), pre-release hardware and access to a range
    of Opteron hardware through the
    <ulink url="http://developer.amd.com/">AMD Developer Center</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
    The port is fully functional. It has been tested on single-CPU and
    multiprocessor (SMP) Opteron configurations. Since the <ulink
    url="../../releases/formal-2.0/NetBSD-2.0.html">release of NetBSD 2.0</ulink>,
    it is a completely supported platform.
    </para>
    <para>
    Frank van der Linden is the maintainer of NetBSD/amd64.

    <portnewsitem date="2007-01-07" title="Abit uGuru Hardware monitor driver">
	Thanks to the work of Mihai Chelaru, a driver for the Abit uGuru
	Hardware system monitor was committed in -current. Abit uGuru is
	a hardware chip in the Abit(TM) motherboards to monitor and control
	the system including fans, temperatures and voltages. For now
	the ug(4) driver only can show the values on these sensors.
	A pullup has been sent for netbsd-4, so it will appear in the
	next major NetBSD version. More information about uGuru can be
	seen at:
