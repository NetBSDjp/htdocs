    <ulink url="http://www.ninthwonder.com/~briggs/">Allen Briggs</ulink> was the
    port maintainer of NetBSD/mac68k up until the release of
    <ulink url="../../releases/formal-1.2/">NetBSD 1.2</ulink>.  He handed this
    position over to <ulink url="../../people/pages/scottr.html">Scott Reynolds</ulink>
    effective as of the 1.2 release.  Here is Allen's story of the origins of
    NetBSD/mac68k:

      <ulink url="http://www.plunk.org/~grantham/">Brad Grantham</ulink>, got to thinking
      that a cool, cheap workstation with a decent interface, tools, and
      capabilities would be a lot of fun to build and sell and was just what the
      world needed.  Well, he started talking to some friends and they decided
      that a nifty first step would be to make some money by selling a real cheap
      Unix for the old Mac II's (that were required for CS majors at Virginia
      Tech for a couple of years -- basic config? 80MB HD, 2MB RAM,
      A/UX 1.0/1.1--later upgraded to 2.0).
    </para>

    <para>
      At this time, Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2) was available on
      the Internet and 386BSD 0.0 had recently been released, so that looked like
      a handy place to start.  Brad and <ulink
      url="http://www.teamten.com/lawrence/">Lawrence Kesteloot</ulink> spent a lot
      of time and sweat getting the system to almost
      work--relieving stress by killing earwigs. They got the system up to
      single-user mode, but hit a slump that Chris Caputo broke.  Chris also did
      a significant amount of work to get the system to be self-hosting and
      read/write SCSI at a decent rate.  About this time, there was lots of wind
      about great things to come from 386BSD 0.2, but there was also these new
      system, NetBSD, that seemed to be going somewhere.  Chris began to merge
      the existing code to NetBSD's 0.8 release.
    </para>

    <para>
      Well, that summer (1993) saw several changes: Lawrence went off to grad
      school; Chris went to Microsoft and got married; Brad moved to California;
      and <ulink url="http://www.ninthwonder.com/~briggs/">Allen Briggs</ulink> and Michael
      Finch started working on the system instead of just hanging around like
      spectators.  They got MacBSD merged into NetBSD 0.8 by the time that NetBSD
      had progressed to 0.9...  At Christmas that year, Brad and Lawrence got
      back together and had a hacking session with Mike in Mike's apartment.
      This led to support for a few more systems and was generally considered to
      be a Good Thing.
    </para>

    <para>
      Allen took on the responsibility of keeping the mac68k code up to date
      and managed to do so while also making some improvements and merging in the
      occasional contributed changes.
