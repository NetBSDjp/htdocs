    NetBSD works with a growing number of the older Macs.  Take a look at
    the <ulink url="curr_info.html">Current Information page</ulink> or join the
    <ulink url="../../MailingLists/#port-mac68k">port-mac68k mailing list</ulink>
    for the most current information. Also check out the <ulink
    url="http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/macbsd-docs/machine-status/">machine-status
    document</ulink> and the <ulink url="http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/spearce/">user
    survey</ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Finally, the NetBSD/mac68k <ulink url="info/">Operating System
    Information</ulink> document provides a list of working hardware and software,
    as well as descriptions of known bugs and common problems.

    <title>What about the PowerMacs?</title>

    <para>
      Although they share a few bits of hardware, the PowerMacs are a
      <emphasis>completely</emphasis> different architecture than their 68k cousins, and you
      can not run NetBSD/mac68k on them. The 68k-emulator does emulate the 68k
      processor very well for Mac OS applications, but it is not sufficient to run
      NetBSD/mac68k for several reasons.
    </para>

    <para>
      Fortunately, there is now a native port of NetBSD that will run on many of
      the PowerMac models.  Please see the <ulink url="../macppc/">NetBSD/macppc
      port page</ulink> for more details.
