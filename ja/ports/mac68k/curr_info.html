<h1>NetBSD/mac68k Current Information</h1>

<hr>
<p>

NetBSD/mac68k is a work in progress.  At the time of this writing, it has
been several months since the release of NetBSD 1.3.3, and NetBSD-current
is still in active development.  Work continues on more robust video
support, audio support, and support for those few machines which do not yet
boot and run from their own console.
<p>

The following systems are now "fully" supported in addition to those
supported by the 1.3 release:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>PowerBook 550c
</ul>
<p>

If you are willing to live with random programs dying on you due to
partially broken support for the 68LC040, the follow machines might also be
considered as "supported", provided you have an external SCSI disk for
those machines which have an internal IDE drive:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>Centris 610
  <li>LC 475
  <li>Performa 475/476
  <li>LC 575
  <li>Performa 575/577/578
  <li>LC 580
  <li>Performa 580/588
  <li>Quadra 605
  <li>LC 630
  <li>Performa 630/631/635/636/637/638
  <li>LC 630 DOS
  <li>Performa 640 DOS
  <li>Quadra 610 DOS
</ul>
<p>

Note:  "Fully supported" implies that the Mac will run off of its local
console and disk (i.e. console-based video, keyboard, and disk are
working).  This means that the system is pretty much "usable".  Many other
features such as ethernet support or full video support may not yet be
available. 

<h2>Hardware Support in Progress</h2>

The following items are frequently asked about on the mailing list, but
support does not yet exist for them in the -current source tree.

<h3>68LC040 Support</h3>

Although Floating Point Emulation (FPE) does work for 68030-based
systems without an FPU, there is currently some trouble with FPE for
68LC040-based systems.  Symptoms of the problem include unpredictable
segmentation faults, rendering these systems rather frustrating to use.
Work is in progress to fix this problem as quickly as possible.
Unfortunately, some 68LC040 chips will still not work even after FPE
support is completed.  These chips will have to be upgraded to full
68040's.

<h3>IDE Support</h3>

Work is in progress to support IDE drives on those machines which have
them.  You can download a
<a href="ftp://ftp.macbsd.com/private/kenn/IDE/">test kernel</a> if you
would like to try it out.  Please contact
<a href="mailto:kenn@synap.ne.jp">Ken Nakata</a> if you have any questions
about IDE support.

<h3>ADB Support</h3>

Most machines now have supported ADB under the direct-to-hardware ADB
driver, but work is in progress to further improve this support.
<p>

In addition to work on generic ADB support, many non-Apple ADB devices
(like multi-button mice) still lack support in NetBSD/mac68k.  Work proceeds
on this as time (and volunteer effort) allows.

<h3>Color Video Support</h3>

This can be broken down into two categories:  onboard-video and
card-based video.  Color video on NuBus-based 8-bit video cards may now be
possible.  Work on onboard-video for II-series hardware is in progress and
hopefully will be available soon.  Support for Quadra internal video should
not be too far behind.  See the
<a href="meta-faq/">Meta-FAQ</a> for pointers to more
information on this one.

<h3>PowerBook support</h3>

Most PowerBooks are probably working under -current, although some may
be suffering from the occasional glitch with internal video.  User
feedback is needed to confirm the status of most of these models, but the
500-series PowerBooks have been reported to work with some -current
kernels, as has the PowerBook 170.

<h3>IIfx/Q900/Q950 Support</h3>

Although several people have looked into getting the Macintosh IIfx or
the Quadra 900/950 to work with NetBSD, it is unlikely that they will be
fully supported any time in the near future.  Several undocumented ASICs
make these machines rather hard to get working (the IOPs in particular).
However, all three will probably work as diskless servers if you are
willing to go to the trouble of setting them up as such.

<h2>Running -current</h2>

To update your system to a more recent version of the kernel and
binaries, you can either
<a href="../../releases/current.html">track NetBSD-current</a>
yourself, or you can grab a binary snapshot.  Scott Reynolds and
Steve Allen maintain NetBSD-current snapshots that are available from 
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/mac68k/">NetBSD.org</a> and
many of its <a href="../../sites/">mirrors</a>.
