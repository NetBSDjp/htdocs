</P>

<P>This FAQ is the Frequently Asked Questions document for the NetBSD/mac68k
project, aka NetBSD/Mac, aka port-mac68k, aka MacBSD, and formerly known as
the Alice project.  Most of the questions and answers herein should apply
equally well to the mac68k ports of other *BSD projects.</P>
<P>If I refer to "we", I mean the team of contributers to NetBSD/mac68k as a
whole. </P>
<P></P>
<H2>1.1 <A NAME="ss1.1"></A> Purpose of this FAQ</H2>

<P>We hope that this document will answer many of the frequently asked questions
of anyone from  beginners to experienced developers regarding all aspects of
the NetBSD/mac68k operating system.  However, particular attention is paid
to those features unique to the Macintosh port.</P>
<P></P>

<H2>1.2 <A NAME="ss1.2"></A> Scope</H2>

<P>With a focus on the Macintosh port of NetBSD, this version of the FAQ
currently attempts to cover NetBSD/mac68k distributions with a focus on the
NetBSD 1.3 release.  New questions or problems arising from the 1.3-current
distribution will be handled as soon as I can get to them.</P>
<P>Since many issues arising from running NetBSD are not specific to the
mac68k port, the reader is advised to check the *BSD FAQ for answers to
general NetBSD questions not answered within this document:</P>

<H2>1.4 <A NAME="ss1.4"></A> Copyright and Disclaimers</H2>

<P>This FAQ is based on the FAQ originally written by David Holcomb
(holcomb@acm.vt.edu)  It contains much of the material from that original
document, but its format has been modified to help it operate better with
Matt Welsh's linuxdoc-sgml tool for producing documentation.</P>
<P>Like David, I am also relying on linuxdoc-sgml for converting the
FAQ from SGML format to several other formats.  The FAQ will use the
constructs of the linuxdoc SGML document type definition as far as I am
capable of making them.</P>
<P>Although I try to verify that the information contained within this FAQ
is correct, I accept no responsibility for loss or damage caused by the
use of the information contained within this FAQ.</P>
<P>This FAQ is (c) 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995 by Colin Wood with portions (c)
1994, 1993  by the Alice Group.</P>
