    NetBSD/acorn32 is a port to ARM- and StrongARM-powered Acorn RiscPC
    compatible machines and is maintained by
    Reinoud Zandijk (<email>reinoud</email>).
    The first formal release of NetBSD/acorn32 is 1.6.
    In earlier releases of NetBSD, these machines are supported by
    <ulink url="../../ports/arm32/">NetBSD/arm32</ulink>.
   </para>
   <para>
    The port first saw light as RiscBSD in 1994 and was later transformed
    into <ulink url="../../ports/arm32/">NetBSD/arm32</ulink>.   In 2001,
    the arm32 port was split into separate ports for the various supported
    hardware types.  NetBSD/acorn32 was one of these.

      The acorn32 portmaster Reinoud Zandijk has released version 3.01 of
      the bootloader. This new bootloader is a complete rewrite and comes as a
      NetBSD compileable single RISC OS relocatable module and is capable of
      booting all supported machines including NC's. It's still in development
      but ought to work fine for all users. You can download the latest released
      version of the module <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/acorn32/boot32,ffa">boot32</ulink>
      and give it a try. Please report problems to the mailing list or to the
      portmaster.
