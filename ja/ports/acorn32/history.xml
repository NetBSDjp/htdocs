  <para>
    NetBSD/acorn32 has been split of from the NetBSD/arm32 port for
    the arm32 port began to grow and grow and included too diverse
    machines to keep it maintainable.
  </para>

  <para>
    NetBSD/arm32 originally formed the basis of a project called
    <quote>RiscBSD</quote>. The RiscBSD group (originally Mark
    Brinicombe, Robert Black, Neil Carson, Manar Hussain, Scott
    Stevens, and Melvin Tang-Richardson) wanted to port a free unix
    operating system to Acorn's newly announced RiscPC system which
    was based on the ARM610 processor. The RiscBSD project was first
    conceived at the launch of Acorn's RiscPC, due to the presence of
    <ulink url="http://www.xara.co.uk/">Xara's</ulink> <ulink
    url="http://www.thermal.demon.co.uk/">Gordon Taylor</ulink>. We
    went ahead, and after carefully studying the likes of Mach, Linux
    and FreeBSD, nominated NetBSD as our OS of choice.
  </para>

  <para>
    As time drifted by, the team reduced in size with only Mark, Neil,
    Robert and Scott remaining. Network Computer (now <ulink
    url="http://www.liberate.com/">Liberate Technologies</ulink>) then
    funded the development of a variety of enhancements to the
    operating system and associated toolchain, for use on the <ulink
    url="http://www.research.compaq.com/SRC/iag/">Digital
    Shark</ulink> computer (see: <ulink
    url="../shark/">NetBSD/shark</ulink>).
