      The pc532 port originally started as a direct port of
      386BSD-0.1. With some freely copyable sources taken from the
      project to port Mach to the pc532, a diskless version of 532BSD
      started working. Along the way it became obvious that more
      people working on the same project would be advantageous and the
      project was merged with the NetBSD project around the time of
      the 0.9 formal release for the i386. NetBSD/pc532 became self
      hosting around March 1994. <ulink url="../../releases/formal-1.0/">NetBSD 1.0</ulink> was
      the first official release for the <ulink
      url="faq.html#what-is-a-pc532">PC532 computer</ulink>.
      The pc532 port was removed on 2008-01-07.

    <portnewsitem date="2008-01-10" title="Port pc532 retired">
      It was decided that port pc532 will not be maintained any longer,
      due to a lack of running hardware and developer interest, and
      that the CPU is no longer supported in gcc, as of version 4.
      Port specific files were removed from the head of CVS, and tagged with
      'pc532-eol-2008'.

      NetBSD/pc532 supports the ``autoboot'' ROM monitor of Nov 1991.
      It includes support to set up auto booting of NetBSD, including a
      secondary boot program that the autoboot monitor will load that in
      turn loads the NetBSD kernel from a NetBSD file system.  Earlier ROM
      monitors can be used with NetBSD/pc532, but requires the user to
      find a way to boot the secondary boot program or the kernel.
    </para>

    <para>
      Most of the pc532 specific development of NetBSD/pc532 was done on
      a machine with 8M of RAM.  It should run with 4M, although it may
      be slower.
    </para>

    <para>
      It supports a subset of the "standard" hardware of its time:

      It currently does not support the AIC SCSI controller.  It also does
      not support program control of the on board leds.  Other SCSI devices
      may be supported even though they were not listed.  If you want
      something supported that is not currently supported, you can
      contribute a driver!
