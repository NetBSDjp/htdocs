<title>NetBSD/mipsco: History</title>

<sect1 id="history">

  <para>
    In July, 2000, Wayne Knowles, a researcher in New Zealand,
    successfully ported NetBSD to his RC3230 made by MIPS Computer Systems,
    Inc.  The RC3230 was a R3000A desktop box commonly called R3000 Magnum;
    a popular workstation that was re-badged by companies such as Bull and
    Olivetti.  The port name was decided to be NetBSD/mipsco so other computers
    by MIPS Computer Systems could be included in it.
  </para>

  <para>
    In early August, NetBSD/mipsco was merged into the main NetBSD tree, and
    saw many initial improvements.  Changes were committed to allow the
    kernel to read either a BSD disklabel created under NetBSD/sparc or a
    MIPS volume header created under Risc OS.  This change allowed the stand
    alone shell to directly load a NetBSD kernel and mount a filesystem -
    NetBSD/mipsco became self-sufficient.

    If you're interested in following or becoming a part of the current 
    development efforts, there's a port-mipsco mailing list.  This list can be
    subscribed to either on the <ulink url="../../mailinglists/#port-mipsco">NetBSD
    mailing lists</ulink> page on the NetBSD web site, or by sending a mail with the
    body of "subscribe port-mipsco" to majordomo@NetBSD.org.  More information is
    also available on the <ulink url="../mipsco/">NetBSD/mipsco port page</ulink>.
