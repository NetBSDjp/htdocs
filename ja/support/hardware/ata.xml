<title>Machine-independent ATA drivers</title>

<para>
The following devices (<emphasis>driver name in parentheses</emphasis>) are supported by
machine-independent ATA drivers.  If you do not see your device listed here,
check your platform's page; there may not yet be a machine-independent driver
for your device.
</para>

<para>
Alternatively, it may be the case that your device is compatible with one
listed here, or your device may not be listed due to an oversight.  If you
are unsure, please boot a -current GENERIC kernel or send mail to
<email>netbsd-help@NetBSD.org</email>.
</para>

<para>
ATA (as well as S-ATA) devices are attached to controllers found on a wide
variety of busses.  To see if your particular controller is supported, please
check the page for the bus it is attached to.
</para>
