        <para>This document is intended to serve as a rough guide
        for the process of translating the NetBSD website.
        Originally, this document was directed towards people
        translating into German, but since the general process is
        the same for other languages as well, this guide was
        adjusted.</para>
        <para>Below you will find several sections that apply to
        all translations, and a few sections that are language
        specific. The general parts use the variable 
        <code>&lt;lang&gt;</code>
        to indicate your language-code (for example, "de" for
        German, "fr" for French etc.).</para>
        <para>Note that the language-code (ISO639-1) may differ
        from the country-code (ISO3166); Swedish is "sv" and is
        spoken in both Sweden, ("SE") and Finland ("FI"). If you
        need to be more precise, use "language-country", like
        "sv-se" for Swedish as spoken in Sweden, which might differ
        from "sv-fi" - Swedish as spoken in Finland. See also the

        <para>We maintain the translated documents under
        subdirectories of the 'htdocs' module on
        anoncvs.NetBSD.org. The general procedure to translate a
        page is basically the same. First of all, you will need to
        check out the ``htdocs'' module. To do so, please use the
        following command:</para>
        <programlisting>  $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
  $ cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot checkout htdocs</programlisting>
        <para>This will create a directory ``htdocs'' in the
        current directory and store all the files in this
        directory. Now change into the directory
        ``htdocs/&lt;lang&gt;'', which is where the files for your
        language will live.</para>

      <title>Translating the files</title>
      <sect3 id="translate">
        <title>Translating a new file</title>
        <para>To translate a new file, please first make sure that
        nobody else is working on this file. Please send an email
        to 
        <code>netbsd-docs-&lt;lang&gt;@NetBSD.org</code>
        to inform the other translators.</para>
        <para>Copy the file(s) you wish to translate into place
        from the english directory tree - you may need to create
        directories accordingly. For example:</para>
        <programlisting>  $ pwd
  /home/you/htdocs/de/
  $ mkdir foo
  $ cp ../foo/* foo
  $ cd foo</programlisting>
        <para>When you edit the files, please pay attention if the
        file has a comment stating that you should be editing not 
        <code>bar.html</code>
        but rather 
        <code>bar.list</code>
        and run 
        <code>make</code>
        afterwards!</para>
        <para>If you want, you can use the shell-script 
        <emphasis>translate.sh</emphasis>
        , which resides in 
        <code>htdocs/</code>
        , to initiate the translation-process. This script copies
        the file, which is given as the first and only argument,
        into the current directory and performs some of the actions
        described below. In particular, it adjusts the 
        <code>img src</code>
        tags, the 
        <code>html</code>
        tag and copies the original CVS tag. However, be careful to
        check these changes when you start the translation.</para>
        <para>As you translate the file, please consult your
        dictionary of choice frequently. It may be helpful to have 
        <code>http://babelfish.altavista.com</code>
        walk over the site (remember, the files you're translating
        are all available at http://www.NetBSD.org). Occasionally,
        Babelfish comes up with good phrases - however, more often
        than that, it creates 
        <emphasis>horrible</emphasis>
        translations, so please be careful!</para>
        <para>Run a spell-checker over the document. Re-read it
        again. View it on a browser and read it carefully
        again.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="adjust">
        <title>Adjust a few tags</title>
        <para>Almost every non-english text contains a few
        characters that are not part of the plain ASCII set, such
        as the Umlauts (&auml;, &ouml;, &uuml;, accents
        and the like). You can choose to represent these using HTML
        entities, or to enter them directly.</para>
        <para>When using HTML entities such as 
        <code>&amp;auml;</code>
        be careful: I usually tend to forget the next letter, so
        that I type 
        <code>f&amp;uuml;</code>
        instead of 
        <code>f&amp;uuml;r</code>
        .</para>
        <para>When entering special characters directly, please
        remember to add the following tag to the 
        <code>&lt;HEAD&gt;</code>
        :</para>
        <programlisting>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"&gt;</programlisting>
        <para>Note that you should 
        <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis>
        use ISO-8859-15 as the charset. Even though this would be
        the best charset to represent all special characters
        commonly encountered in German (and other European language
        based) documents (such as the Euro-symbol), not all
        browsers are able to handle this charset. Therefore, please
        use ISO-8859-1 and use numeric entity references when you
        need to include a character from a different
        charset.</para>
        <para>If you translate into a non-european language, please
        adjust the charset accordingly.</para>
        <para>Finally, adjust the 
        <code>HTML</code>
        tag to contain your language-code (for example: 
        <code>&lt;HTML lang="de"&gt;</code>
        ). Note that the 
        <code>DOCTYPE</code>
        tag should remain untouched, that is it 
        <emphasis>should</emphasis>
        end in 
        <code>//EN&gt;</code>
        rather than 
        <code>//DE&gt;</code>
        . The reason for this is that the ``EN'' in the 
        <code>DOCTYPE</code>
        tag does not specify the language used in the document, but
        the language used in the DTD definition. The language used
        in the document is then specified in the 
        <code>&lt;HTML&gt;</code>
        tag as described above.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="links">
        <title>Adjust the links</title>
        <para>You need to adjust the links to other pages! Some of
        the pages linked to from this page may have been
        translated, in which case the relative URL should be just
        fine. However, if the link has not been translated yet, we
        need to direct the user to the english original. Be careful
        when adjusting the links, particularly to pages in the same
        directory that have 
        <emphasis>not</emphasis>
        been translated yet. For example, if you are in the
        directory 
        <code>/home/you/htdocs/&lt;lang&gt;/foo</code>
        and the page contains a link to 
        <code>../bar/baz.html</code>
        , you will need to change it to 
        <code>../../bar/baz.html</code>
        . If the page contains a link to 
        <code>baz.html</code>
        (that is, to a file in the 
        <emphasis>current</emphasis>
        directory, which has not yet been translated), you need to
        change it to 
        <code>../../foo/baz.html</code>
        .</para>
        <para>Images can easily be adjusted by simply prepending a 
        <code>../</code>
        to the 
        <code>src="../images/foo.gif"</code>
        .</para>
        <para>After you have translated a page it may be necessary
        to adjust the links 
        <emphasis>to</emphasis>
        this page - as the page had not been translated before,
        other pages may still link to the english original. Change
        into the root directory of the German translation ( 
        <code>/home/you/htdocs/&lt;lang&gt;/</code>
        ) and search through all files in this directory tree for
        links to your page and make the necessary adjustments. One
        not necessarily terribly efficient way of doing so would be
        
        <code>grep -r "dir/doc.html" *</code>
        </para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="include">
        <title>Include the original version</title>
        <para>Please always include a comment which explains which
        exact english version the document is based on. For
        example:</para>
        <programlisting>  &dollar;NetBSD: index.html,v 1.611 2001/11/30 19:30:43 dent Exp $
  &lt;br&gt; &lt;!-- Based on english version: --&gt;
  &lt;!-- NetBSD: index.html,v 1.611 2001/11/30 19:30:43 dent Exp $ --&gt;</programlisting>
        <para>If you are familiar with CVS or RCS, you will
        recognize the format. NetBSD's CVS server has been
        configured to use the "&dollar;NetBSD$" tag rather than the
        "&dollar;Id$" tag, so that the proper revision number etc. are
        substituted when you commit the file - the second tag will
        remain untouched, as it is not prepended with the "$" sign.
        Obviously, it's important to remove the "$" from the
        original tag so that this will not be updated and it
        remains obvious upon which original version the document is
        based.</para>

      <sect3 id="sh">

        and 
        <emphasis>adjust.sed</emphasis>
        (which you can also copy over from /htdocs/de). You need to
        adjust the file 
        <emphasis>adjust.sed</emphasis>
        to your language. An example:</para>
        <programlisting>  $ ls &lt;lang&gt;

      changes. There are two ways:</para>
      <sect3 id="with-cvs">
        <title>Creating a diff against CVS</title>
        <para>If you are working from within a directory that was
        originally checked out from anoncvs, and you have only
        modified files that already are in the CVS repository, then
        you can create a diff using the following commands:</para>
        <programlisting>  $ pwd
  /home/you/htdocs/&lt;lang&gt;/
  $ cvs update -dP
  $ cvs diff -bu &gt; /tmp/htdocs.&lt;lang&gt;.diff</programlisting>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="without-cvs">
        <title>Creating a diff against another directory</title>
        <para>If you work from within a copy of the anoncvs tree,
        and/or if you added files that are not yet in the CVS
        repository, you can create a diff against a clean anoncvs
        directory. For example:</para>
        <programlisting>  $ ls
  htdocs myhtdocs
  $ cd myhtdocs/&lt;lang&gt;/
  $ diff -burN -x *CVS* -I'\$NetBSD' ../../htdocs/&lt;lang&gt; . &gt; /tmp/htdocs.&lt;lang&gt;.diff</programlisting>
        <para>Please see &man.cvs.1; and 
        <code>http://www.cvshome.org</code>
        for details of CVS. The generated patch can now be sent via
        email to either 
        <email>www@NetBSD.org</email>
        or the Mailing-List
        &lt;netbsd-docs-&lt;lang&gt;@NetBSD.org&gt;.</para>
