<h2>NetBSD Developer Documentation: Release Engineering: The Release Engineering
Process</h2>

<h3><a name="make_release">4.4 How to make a NetBSD release</a></h3>

<h4>4.4.1 Overview</h4>

<p>
The NetBSD Release process is an eight week process which is intended
to make it possible to generate frequent quality releases without
stalling development on the main branch.  The goal is to have two
NetBSD releases per year.

<p>
In the description below, <var>VERSION</var> can have different
textual representations depending on context.  For instance, if
describing the release of NetBSD 1.2, <var>VERSION</var> would be
"1-2" when used in a CVS command, "1.2" when talking about the
version as announced to the public or defined in
src/sys/conf/newvers.sh, or "1_2" when talking about the definition
of the <b>NetBSD<var>VERSION</var></b> constant in src/sys/sys/param.h.

<p>
The basic timeline for a release looks like:
<dl>
<dt> <a href="#rel_week0">Week 0: Beginning of release cycle</a>
<dd>
	The release schedule is sent as a reminder to all NetBSD
	developers and mirror maintainers.

<dt> <a href="#rel_week1">Week 1: Snapshot sanity check</a>
<dd>
	Port maintainers should try to build full releases, to
	ensure that the release generation machinery is functional.

<dt> <a href="#rel_week2">Week 2: Creation of release branch and feature
    freeze</a>
<dd>
	The release branch is created, and developers are disallowed
	from committing new features to the release branch without
	permission from the Release Engineer.

<dt> <a href="#rel_week3">Week 3: First beta release</a>
<dd>
	Binary snapshots are released as <b>NetBSD <var>VERSION</var>_ALPHA</b>.

<dt> <a href="#rel_week4">Week 4: Non-critical bug fix freeze</a>
<dd>
	Developers are disallowed from committing any changes other
	than critical bug fixes to the release branch without
	permission from the Release Engineer.  Mid-week, the release
	branch is tagged <b>netbsd-<var>VERSION</var>-BETA</b>.

<dt> <a href="#rel_week5">Week 5: Second beta release</a>
<dd>
	Binary snapshots are released as <b>NetBSD <var>VERSION</var>_BETA</b>.

<dt> <a href="#rel_week6">Week 6: Code freeze</a>
<dd>
	Developers are disallowed from committing <em>ANY</em> changes
	to the release branch without permission from the Release
	Engineer.

<dt> <a href="#rel_week7">Week 7: Tag final sources</a>
<dd>
	The release branch is tagged <b>netbsd-<var>VERSION</var>-FINAL</b>,
	and port maintainers begin generating final release binaries.

<dt> <a href="#rel_week8">Week 8: Release</a>
<dd>
	The release is announced to the world.

<p>
Yet to be done in this document:
	<ul>
	<li> Fill in various details.  (Search for XXX.)
	<li> General background; note existence of "Release Engineer,"
		his/her responsibilities, expand notion that development
		continues as normal on trunk, etc.
	<li> More details on release branch management: procedure
		for pulling changes up, procedure for getting approval
		for changes, etc.
	<li> Post-release patching.  (It may make sense to re-work the
		various "NetBSD" definitions in src/sys/sys/param.h
		in light of post-release patches.)
	</ul>

<h4><a name="rel_week0">4.4.2 Week 0: Beginning of release cycle</a></h4>

	<ul>
	<li> Dates should be set for the various events in the release
		cycle
	<li> The updated release cycle calendar should be sent as
		a reminder to NetBSD developers
		(<i>developers@NetBSD.org</i>) and mirror
		maintainers (<i>XXX DETAILS</i>).
	</ul>

<h4><a name="rel_week1">4.4.3 Week 1: Snapshot sanity check</a></h4>

	<ul>
	<li> Port maintainers should try to build full releases, to
		ensure that the release generation machinery is
		functional.
	</ul>

<h4><a name="rel_week2">4.4.4 Week 2: Creation of release branch and
    feature freeze</a></h4>

	<ul>
	<li> Update <b>doc-operating-system</b> in
		src/gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac to the version to
		be released. Add an appropriate
		<b>doc-operating-system-NetBSD-X.Y</b> line too,
		if it's not there yet (contact <i>wiz@NetBSD.org</i> in case
		of questions).
	<li> Tag the base of the release branch with a command like:<br>
	    <pre>cvs rtag -a netbsd-<var>VERSION</var>-base src</pre>

	<li> Create the release branch with a command like:<br>
	    <pre>cvs rtag -a -b -rnetbsd-<var>VERSION</var>-base netbsd-<var>VERSION</var> src</pre>

	<li> On the trunk, do the following:
		<ul>
		<li> Update the <b>NetBSD</b> constant in src/sys/sys/param.h
			to be a date soon after the final release is expected.
		<li> Update the <b>NetBSD<var>VERSION</var></b>
			constant in src/sys/sys/param.h so that it uses the
			appropriate major and minor version numbers, and is
			defined to "2" (to indicate NetBSD-current, after the
			release).
		<li> Update <b>osr</b> in src/sys/conf/newvers.sh to
			indicate the proper release
			with an "A" suffix (to indicate
			NetBSD-current, after the release).
		<li> Update send-pr. (XXX HOW?)
		</ul>

	<li> On the release branch, do the following:
		<ul>
		<li> Update the <b>NetBSD</b> constant in src/sys/sys/param.h
			to be the date of the expected "ALPHA" distributions.
		<li> Update the <b>NetBSD</b><var>VERSION</var>
			constant in src/sys/sys/param.h so that it uses the
			appropriate major and minor version numbers, and is
			defined to "1" (to indicate the appropriate
			formal release.)
		<li> Update <b>osr</b> in src/sys/conf/newvers.sh to
			indicate the proper release
			with an "_ALPHA" suffix.
		<li> Update send-pr. (XXX HOW?)
		</ul>

	<li> Change FTP/SUP service on <i>ftp.NetBSD.org</i> and
		<i>sup.NetBSD.org</i> to distribute the release
		branch.

	<li> Announce to the world the fact that the release process
		is underway.  Note that FTP and SUP service will be
		distributing the release branch during the release
		process.

	<li> Notify developers of release branch creation.  Include
		procedure for accessing branch and notification that
		they should not be committing new features to the
		branch without permission of the Release Engineer.

	<li> Update the release web page with the expected and actual
		dates.

	<li> Create SUP collections for the new release. (XXX DETAILS?)

	<li> Notify mirror maintainers about the new SUP collections,
		so that they can start supping them before beta
