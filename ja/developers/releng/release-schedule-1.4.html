<h2> NetBSD Developer Documentation: Release Engineering:
1.4 Release Schedule </h2>

<p> The release engineer for NetBSD 1.4 is Perry Metzger, <a
href="perry@netbsd.org">perry@netbsd.org</a>. Pulllups go to the
usual address; see <a href="pullups.html">Submitting Release Branch
Pullup Requests</a> for information on this. Note that during the
alpha-test period pullups must be submitted for approval, but once
approved you need to do the pull-up yourself. After the alpha-test
period, releng will commit the pullups. </p>

<h3> Schedule </h3>

<table frame=box border=1>

<tr valign=top> <td> April 1st: <br> BRANCH </td>
<td> At the branch, -current sup collections and the checked out
sources on ftp.netbsd.org start tracking the branch. All commits
to the release branch need to be cleared with Release Engineering
in advance. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> April 1st: <br> ALPHA tag </td>
<td> Build Masters should begin producing NetBSD 1.4_ALPHA releases.
Please complete this work ASAP. It is understood that slow hardware
will take time, but the modern hardware ports should finish quickly.
DAYS COUNT. Every extra day your Alpha is out is another day we
get for testing. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> April 16th: <br> BETA tag </td>
<td> Build Masters should begin producing NetBSD 1.4_BETA releases.
Please complete this work ASAP. DAYS COUNT. <br> All changes to
the 1.4 branch after this point are to be cleared in detail with
Release Engineering, and will be permitted only if they impact only
documentation or if they are significant bugs. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> April 30th: <br> Code Freeze </td>
<td> All changes to the 1.4 branch after this point are done by
release engineering only. If it isn't done by now, it goes into
1.4.1 unless it is a "stop the presses" kind of bug, in which case
it will be pulled up. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> May 3rd: <br> Final Tag </td>
<td> Final 1.4 release tag in morning, UTC+0500.  Build Masters
should begin producing NetBSD 1.4 releases. Mirrors should begin
syncing up as soon as release contents appear. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> May 10th: <br> Soft Release <br> Date </td>
<td> The release directories on the FTP server are unprotected.
</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> May 12th: <br> Announcement </td>
<td> Done mid-week to avoid download surge.  ftp.netbsd.org ftp
and sup collections revert to the head. </td> </tr>
