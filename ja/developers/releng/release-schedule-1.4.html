<h2> NetBSD Developer Documentation: Release Engineering:
1.4 Release Schedule </h2>

<p> The release engineer for NetBSD 1.4.4 is H&aring;vard Eidnes, <a
href="mailto:he@NetBSD.org">he@NetBSD.org</a>. Pull-ups go to the
usual address; see <a href="pullups.html">Submitting Release Branch
Pull-up Requests</a> for information on this.  The exact details of who
does what during a given point of a release cycle will vary somewhat;
the procedures for each release cycle will be publicised on the
NetBSD project-internal mailing list for developers.<p>


<h3> Schedule </h3>

The release of NetBSD 1.4.4 does not currently have a time schedule
set in stone.  The release engineering team is currently receiving and
processing pullups to continue maintaining the <b>netbsd-1-4</b>
release branch, and this release branch will eventually become NetBSD
1.4.4.  At this time we are operating under the regime where
<em>patches will drive releases, not the other way around.</em><p>

The original schedule for the release of NetBSD 1.4 had this schedule
set at the time the release was planned:

<table border=1>

<tr valign=top> <td> Day 0: <br> BRANCH </td>
<td> At the branch, -current sup collections and the checked out
sources on ftp.NetBSD.org start tracking the branch. All commits
to the release branch need to be cleared with Release Engineering
in advance. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> Day 0: <br> ALPHA tag </td>
<td> Build Masters should begin producing NetBSD 1.4_ALPHA releases.
Please complete this work ASAP. It is understood that slow hardware
will take time, but the modern hardware ports should finish quickly.
DAYS COUNT. Every extra day your Alpha is out is another day we
get for testing. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> Day 15: <br> BETA tag </td>
<td> Build Masters should begin producing NetBSD 1.4_BETA releases.
Please complete this work ASAP. DAYS COUNT. <br> All changes to
the 1.4 branch after this point are to be cleared in detail with
Release Engineering, and will be permitted only if they impact only
documentation or if they are significant bugs. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> Day 30: <br> Code Freeze </td>
<td> All changes to the 1.4 branch after this point are done by
release engineering only. If it isn't done by now, it goes into
1.4.1 unless it is a "stop the presses" kind of bug, in which case
it will be pulled up. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> Day 34: <br> Final Tag </td>
<td> Final 1.4 release tag in morning, UTC+0500.  Build Masters
should begin producing NetBSD 1.4 releases. Mirrors should begin
syncing up as soon as release contents appear. </td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> Day 41: <br> Soft Release <br> Date </td>
<td> The release directories on the FTP server are unprotected.
</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top> <td> Day 43: <br> Announcement </td>
<td> Done mid-week to avoid download surge.  ftp.NetBSD.org ftp
and sup collections revert to the head. </td> </tr>
