<SECTION>General Notes on translating htdocs

<ENTRY>intro Introduction
This document is intended to serve as a rough guide for the process of
translating the NetBSD website.  Originally, this document was directed
towards people translating into German, but since the general process is the
same for other languages as well, this guide was adjusted.

<P>
Below you will find several sections that apply to all translations, and a few
sections that are language specific.  The general parts use the variable
<code>&lt;lang&gt;</code> to indicate your language-code (for example, "de" for German,
"fr" for French etc.).

Note that the language-code (ISO639-1) may differ from the
country-code (ISO3166); Swedish is "sv" and is spoken in both Sweden,
("SE") and Finland ("FI"). If you need to be more precise, use
"language-country", like "sv-se" for Swedish as spoken in Sweden,
which might differ from "sv-fi" - Swedish as spoken in Finland. See
also the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/dirlang.html">HTML4 language
specification</a>.

<P>
If you find any of the information given in this document to be misleading or
incorrect, if you have any suggestions, corrections or comments, please don't
hesitate to contact <www@NetBSD.org>.

<ENTRY>ml Mailing Lists
We have set up a few Mailing Lists for the translators -- should you wish to
initiate the translation into a different language and would like to set up a
similar Mailing List, please send an email to <jschauma@NetBSD.org>.

<ENTRY>cvs-setup CVS Setup

We maintain the translated documents under subdirectories of the 'htdocs'
module on anoncvs.NetBSD.org.  The general procedure to translate a page is
basically the same.  First of all, you will need to check out the ``htdocs''
module.  To do so, please set your <code>CVSROOT</code> to
<B>:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot</B> and issue the command:
<PRE>
 $ cvs login
</PRE>

<P>
When prompted for a password, simply enter 'anoncvs' and hit &lt;return&gt;.  After this, you can check out the module using
<PRE>
 $ cvs checkout htdocs
</PRE>

<P>
This will create a directory ``htdocs'' in the current directory and store all
the files in this directory.  Now change into the directory ``htdocs/&lt;lang&gt;'',
which is where the files for your language will live.


<ENTRY>change Changing existing files
If you have encountered spelling errors or want to change anything else (for
example, adjust a link), simply edit the file with your favorite editor.

<SECTION>Translating the files

<ENTRY>translate Translating a new file
To translate a new file, please first make sure that nobody else is working on
this file.  We usually try to post who's working on which files to <code><a
href="http://www.NetBSD.org/~jschauma/">http://www.NetBSD.org/~jschauma/</a></code>.
If nobody appears to have claimed the section you intend to translate, please
send an email to <code>netbsd-docs-&lt;lang&gt;@cs.stevens-tech.edu</code> to
inform the other translators.

<P>
Copy the file(s) you wish to translate into place from the english directory
tree - you may need to create directories accordingly.  For example:
<PRE>
 $ pwd
 /home/you/htdocs/de/
 $ mkdir foo
 $ cp ../foo/* foo
 $ cd foo
</PRE>

<P>
When you edit the files, please pay attention if the file has a comment
stating that you should be editing not <code>bar.html</code> but rather
<code>bar.list</code> and run <code>make</code> afterwards!

<P>
If you want, you can use the shell-script <EM>translate.sh</EM>, which resides
in <code>htdocs/</code>, to initiate the translation-process.  This script copies
the file, which is given as the first and only argument, into the current
directory and performs some of the actions described below.  In particular, it
adjusts the <code>img src</code> tags, the <code>html</code> tag and copies the original
CVS tag.  However, be careful to check these changes when you start the
translation.

<P>
As you translate the file, please consult your dictionary of choice
frequently.  It may be helpful to have <code>http://babelfish.altavista.com</code>
walk over the site (remember, the files you're translating are all available at
http://www.NetBSD.org). Occasionally, Babelfish comes up with good phrases -
however, more often than that, it creates <EM>horrible</EM> translations, so
please be careful!

<P>
Run a spell-checker over the document.  Re-read it again.  View it on a
browser and read it carefully again.

<ENTRY>adjust Adjust a few tags
Almost every non-english text contains a few characters that are not part of
the plain ASCII set, such as the Umlauts (ä, ö, ü, accents and the like).  You
can choose to represent these using HTML entities, or to enter them directly.

<P>
When using HTML entities such as <code>&amp;auml;</code> be careful: I usually tend to
forget the next letter, so that I type <code>f&amp;uuml;</code> instead of
<code>f&amp;uuml;r</code>.

<P>
When entering special characters directly, please remember to add the
following tag to the <code>&lt;HEAD&gt;</code>:

<P>
<PRE>
     &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that you should <B>not</B> use ISO-8859-15 as the charset.  Even though
this would be the best charset to represent all special characters commonly
encountered in German (and other European language based) documents (such as
the Euro-symbol), not all browsers are able to handle this charset.
Therefore, please use ISO-8859-1 and use numeric entity references when you
need to include a character from a different charset.

<P>
If you translate into a non-european language, please adjust the charset
accordingly.

<P>
Finally, adjust the <code>HTML</code> tag to contain your language-code (for
example: <code>&lt;HTML lang="de"&gt;</code>). Note that the
<code>DOCTYPE</code> tag should remain untouched, that is it <EM>should</EM>
end in <code>//EN&gt;</code> rather than <code>//DE&gt;</code>.  The reason
for this is that the ``EN'' in the <code>DOCTYPE</code> tag does not specify
the language used in the document, but the language used in the DTD
definition.  The language used in the document is then specified in the
<code>&lt;HTML&gt;</code> tag as described above.

<ENTRY>links Adjust the links
You need to adjust the links to other pages!  Some of the pages linked to from
this page may have been translated, in which case the relative URL should be
just fine.  However, if the link has not been translated yet, we need to
direct the user to the english original.  Be careful when adjusting the links,
particularly to pages in the same directory that have <EM>not</EM> been
translated yet.  For example, if you are in the directory
<code>/home/you/htdocs/&lt;lang&gt;/foo</code> and the page contains a link to
<code>../bar/baz.html</code>, you will need to change it to
<code>../../bar/baz.html</code>.  If the page contains a link to <code>baz.html</code>
(that is, to a file in the <EM>current</EM> directory, which has not yet been
translated), you need to change it to <code>../../foo/baz.html</code>.

<P>
Images can easily be adjusted by simply prepending a <code>../</code> to the
<code>src="../images/foo.gif"</code>.

<P>
After you have translated a page it may be necessary to adjust the links <EM>to</EM> this page - as the page had not been translated before, other pages may
still link to the english original.  Change into the root directory of the
German translation (<code>/home/you/htdocs/&lt;lang&gt;/</code>) and search through all
files in this directory tree for links to your page and make the necessary
adjustments.  One not necessarily terribly efficient way of doing so would be
<code>grep -r "dir/doc.html" *</code>

<ENTRY>include Include the original version
Please always include a comment which explains which exact english version the
document is based on.  For example:
<PRE>
     &#36;NetBSD: index.html,v 1.6 2002/07/02 21:05:59 jschauma Exp &#36;&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;!-- Based on english version:                                   --&gt;
     &lt;!--   NetBSD: index.html,v 1.611 2001/11/30 19:30:43 dent Exp $ --&gt;
</PRE>
If you are familiar with CVS or RCS, you will recognize the format.  NetBSD's
CVS server has been configured to use the "&#36;NetBSD: ... &#36;" tag rather than
the "&#36;Id: &#36;" tag, so that the proper revision number etc. are
substituted when you commit the file - the second tag will remain untouched,
as it is not prepended with the "$" sign.  Obviously, it's important to
remove the "$" from the original tag so that this will not be updated and it
remains obvious upon which original version the document is based.

<ENTRY>sh translate.sh
Again, as mentioned above, some of these tasks are performed by the two
scripts <EM>translate.sh</EM> and <EM>adjust.sed</EM> (which you can also
copy over from /htdocs/de). You need to adjust the file <EM>adjust.sed</EM> to your language.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
 $ ls &lt;lang&gt;
 adjust.sed
 $ cd &lt;lang&gt;/some/dir
 $ sh ../../../translate.sh &lt;lang&gt; ../../../some/dir/file.list
</pre>

<SECTION>Guidelines and Caveats

The documents linked below discuss a few guidelines and caveats that are
specific to a certain language.  This generally includes phrases that are
difficult to translate, ways to treat certain phrases and proper names,
formats and the like.

<p>

Some words or phrases can not or should not always be translated.  For
example, legal phrases such as ``<cite>Copyright &copy; 1994-2003 The NetBSD
Foundation, Inc.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.</cite>'' should only be translated if
the correct and legally valid translation is known -- when in doubt, leave it
in engish.
<P>
In general, if there is a name or a phrase that could not be translated and
it is not a common english phrase used in your language, it should be left
untranslated, but placed within a <EM>&lt;cite lang="en"&gt;</EM> or
<EM>&lt;em lang="en"&gt;</em> tag.

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="translate-french.html">French</a></li>
<li><a href="translate-german.html">German</a></li>
<li><a href="translate-spanish.html">Spanish</a></li>
</ul>

<SECTION>Submit your changes

After you have carefully evaluated your work and find it ready for the world
to review, you need to commit the changes.  There are two ways:

<ENTRY>with-cvs Creating a diff against CVS

If you are working from within a directory that was originally checked out
from anoncvs, and you have only modified files that already are in the CVS
repository, then you can create a diff using the following commands:

<P>
<PRE>
 $ pwd
 /home/you/htdocs/&lt;lang&gt;/
 $ cvs update -dP
 $ cvs diff -bu > /tmp/htdocs.&lt;lang&gt;.diff
</PRE>

<P>

<ENTRY>without-cvs Creating a diff against another directory

If you work from within a copy of the anoncvs tree, and/or if you added files
that are not yet in the CVS repository, you can create a diff against a clean
anoncvs directory.  For example:

<PRE>
 $ ls
 htdocs    myhtdocs
 $ cd myhtdocs/&lt;lang&gt;/
 $ diff -burN -x *CVS* -I'\$NetBSD' ../../htdocs/&lt;lang&gt; . > /tmp/htdocs.&lt;lang&gt;.diff
</PRE>

<P>
Please see cvs(1) and <code>http://www.cvshome.org</code> for details of CVS.  The
generated patch can now be sent via email to either
<www@NetBSD.org> or the Mailing-List
&lt;netbsd-docs-&lt;lang&gt;@cs.stevens-tech.edu&gt;.

<P>

<ENTRY>done Done

 Congratulations, we're done.  The changes submitted via email will be made
available for review at <code>http://netbsd.netmeister.org/&lt;lang&gt;/</code>
soon after.  Announce the changes you made to the mailing-list and other
interested people and let them review your work (often, a second pair of eyes
finds errors or phrases that slipped through your spellcheck).  Finally, after
the changes have been approved they will be commited to the original
document-tree soon after, so that they show up under
<code>http://www.NetBSD.org/&lt;lang&gt;/</code>.
