<DEVHEADING>Resolving Problem Reports

The NetBSD Project uses the GNATS "Problem Report" database to
accept and track bug/problem reports from all users of NetBSD. When
used properly, this facility allows us to make sure that no problem
with the NetBSD software goes unfixed.
<p>
The GNATS database uses Internet E-mail as its principal
submission mechanism, and keeps the problem reports (commonly
abbreviated "PR") in Internet E-mail format, with an extended header
format in the body of the message. The database uses one file per
PR, and each category is a directory, in a manner similar to the
MH mail system, and NetNews.

<LIST>

<SECTION>Accessing the Problem Report Database

<ENTRY>webinterface Web Interface
There is a web-based interface to the GNATS database that has both
a <a href="../Gnats/">tree of database summary pages</a>, and a <a
href="../Misc/query-pr.html">search</a> facility. The web interface
has some limitations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The web interface is several hours behind the actual database
because it operates on a copy of the database for security.
<p>
<li>The web interface <strong>does not</strong> provide access
to any PR marked "confidential."
<p>
<li>PRs displayed by a web browser have been through sufficient
transformation that "cut &amp; paste" is not likely to do what you
expect (i.e. patches will not apply properly because of white space
substitution, uuencoded text will not decode properly).
</ul>

<ENTRY>netbsd-bugs The netbsd-bugs Mailing List
All PRs, confidential or not, are sent to the 
<A HREF="/MailingLists/#netbsd-bugs">netbsd-bugs</A> mailing list,
so that subscribers can see each PR as it is added to the database.

<ENTRY>gnatscommands The GNATS commands on gnats.NetBSD.org
The GNATS database lives on the host <b>gnats.NetBSD.org</b>.
All developers are given an account on that host so that they can
directly manipulate PRs, and access confidential PRs. The commands 
<b>edit-pr</b> and <b>query-pr</b> live in <b>/usr/pkg/bin</b>;
Make sure you have that directory in your <b>$PATH</b>.
<p>
There are no UNIX Manual pages for these commands.
As with most GNU software, there are "info" pages available through
the <b>info</b> command. Also, invoking <b>query-pr</b> without
any arguments will cause it to give its usage message.
<p>
The <b>query-pr</b> command is a proper database query interface; it
has a large number of options to search the database. Once you know the
PR number of the PR you wish to manipulate, you can:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>query-pr --full</b> <i>number</i>
<p>
This will dump out the full PR without any transformation to
standard output.
<p>
<li><p><b>edit-pr</b> <i>number</i>
<p>This command will start up a text editor (<b>vi</b> by default;
but this can be overridden by the <b>$EDITOR</b> or <b>$VISUAL</b>
environment variables), so that changes can be made to the PR.
</ul>
<p>

<b>The Common Reasons to "edit-pr"</b>
<p>
The most common changes made to a PR are:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Change the PR's <b>&gt;State:</b> field to one of the values
listed in <A HREF="../Misc/pr-states.html">state</A> as it progresses
through the process of resolving it.
<p>
The person listed in the <b>&gt;Responsible:</b> field of the
PR should be making these state changes, as it is necessary.
<p>

<li>Change the PR's <b>&gt;Responsible:</b> field to the account name
of a developer who will handle the PR.
This person becomes the PR Submitter's primary contact for
getting the problem resolved.
<p>
This field can have any username from /etc/passwd on <b>gnats.NetBSD.org</b>
and anyone listed in the
<b>/usr/pkg/share/gnats/gnats-db/gnats-adm/responsible</b>
file.
<p>
All PRs get a default Responsible Person when they are initially
filed, appropriate to the category in which the PR was filed (e.g.
"security-officer" for PRs in the "security" category). The
<b>/usr/pkg/share/gnats/gnats-db/gnats-adm/categories</b> file
lists the default Responsible Person for each category.
<p>
There is also a table of <a href="../Gnats/#table-responsible">developers
responsible for current PRs</a>.
<p>

<li>Change the PR's <b>&gt;Category:</b> field.
<p>
It is not unusual for a PR Submitter to have made a poor category
choice. There is a list of <a href="../Gnats/#category-descriptions">PR
categories and their definitions</a> and a table of <a
href="../Gnats/#table-category">current PRs by category</a>.
<p>
The <b>/usr/pkg/share/gnats/gnats-db/gnats-adm/categories</b> file
lists the valid categories and the default Responsible Person.
It is usually necessary to change the <b>&gt;Responsible:</b> field at
the same time to a more appropriate person. Most often, the correct
Responsible Person is the default Responsible Person for the new
category.
<p>

<li>Change other <a href="../Misc/pr-fields.html">PR Fields</a> according
to the analysis of the responsible developer.
</ol>
<p>

Edit each field you think needs modifying, then save the file and
exit the editor. The <b>edit-pr</b> will then prompt for a short
explanation to be typed for each key field change (mostly
<b>&gt;State:</b> and <b>&gt;Responsible:</b>). This text is entered
one line at time, ending with ^D.
<p>
This text is then sent via e-mail to the PR Submitter, the
Responsible developer, and gnats-admin@NetBSD.org.  It is also
appended to the PR by <b>edit-pr</b> along with the user ID of the
developer making the change, a timestamp, and the entered text.
<p>
Unfortunately, no external editor can be invoked at this
point; if you make a mistake, you'll have to use <b>edit-pr</b> to
correct it.

<SECTION>Resolving Problem Reports

<ENTRY>ideal The Ideal Process
In an ideal world, the process for a problem report is as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>A NetBSD user has a problem with NetBSD. He invokes the
<b>send-pr</b> command on his system (assuming it's still stable
enough to do that), and files a Problem Report. Hopefully, he
follows all the advice found in <a
href="../Misc/pr-hints.html">"What goes into a
Problem Report."</a>
<p>
If the user's own system is not stable enough to use <b>send-pr</b>,
there is a <a href="../Misc/send-pr.html">web interface</a> that can
be used to submit problem reports.
<p>

<li>When the PR arrives at <b>gnats.NetBSD.org</b>, the GNATS
database system examines it, and files it. If the PR is malformed,
it will be filed in the <b>pending</b> category, marked confidential,
awaiting manual intervention by the GNATS database administrator.
<p>
If the format is OK, the PR is assigned a PR number, filed into
the requested category, and E-mailed out again to the default
responsible party for the category, and to the <a
href="../MailingLists/#netbsd-bugs">netbsd-bugs</a> mailing list.
A notice of the PR number and default Responsible Person is also
E-mailed back to the PR Submitter.
<p>

<li>The Responsible Person should read and analyze the PR. Any
other person who has insight into the problem should also <a
href="../Misc/send-pr.html#appending">add whatever information they
can to the problem report</a> (this is why the report is mailed
out to a mailing list; a wide audience increases the probability
that a key insight needed to solve the problem will be discovered).
<p>
If the default Responsible Person determines that another
developer is a more appropriate Responsible Person, the PR should
be reassigned with <b>edit-pr</b>. The new Responsible Person
should read and analyze the PR.
<p>

<li>Once a cause and potential fix has been identified, a
description should be added to the PR, and the <a
href="../Misc/pr-states.html">state</a> should be changed to
<b>analyzed</b>. At this point, implementation of the fix for the
problem begins.
<p>
This part of the process should begin as quickly as possible,
since a user with a current problem is suffering, but also has his
attention engaged, and his hardware available for testing potential
fixes. If a PR is allowed to languish, the opportunity to reproduce
the problem and test potential fixes may be lost.
<p>

<li>Once the implementation of the fix is completed and communicated
to the PR submitter, the PR <a href="/Misc/pr-states.html">state</a>
should be changed to <b>feedback</b>, awaiting response from the PR
submitter that the fix really works.
<p>
A PR should also be put into <b>feedback</b> state when input
is required from the submitter to complete the analysis of the PR
(i.e. when you ask them a question), or when you need information
from some other source (essentially, <b>feedback</b> is a wait
state).
<p>

<li>Once the PR submitter confirms that the fix works, the PR
can be <b>closed</b>.
</ol>
<p>

At each step of the PR handling process, make sure that feedback
and other analysis and commentary is <a
href="../Misc/send-pr.html#appending">appended to the PR</a> by using
a proper E-mail subject line and making sure that the messages are
copied to gnats-bugs@NetBSD.org. Having a complete record of
information about the PR is valuable both while hunting down the
bug and for future system maintenance.
<p>
If at all possible, it is important to get any fix committed to
the CVS trunk <a href="releng/pullups.html">pulled
up</a> by <a href="releng/">NetBSD Release Engineering</a>
to the "-release" branch, so that people who are tracking that
branch can get the fix right away rather than waiting for the next
major release of NetBSD. This also makes it possible for the next
point release of NetBSD to have the fix.
<p>
The NetBSD Community is a whole lot of very smart, and very
experienced people. If you're having trouble analyzing a problem
report, ask questions in the appropriate <a href="../MailingLists/">mailing
list</a>; more than likely, someone will be able to help.

<ENTRY>otherways Other Ways Things Get Done
The Ideal Process was described above. That's not the only way
that problem reports get handled. All of the principal people
involved in NetBSD are pretty busy, and can't devote full attention
to this project. As such, if you see a PR that you can solve that
hasn't been attended to yet, go claim it by setting yourself as
the Responsible Person with <b>edit-pr</b>, and solve it.
<p>
Even if you don't feel qualified to hack the code yourself, if
you can offer a test case or other information, send it along to
GNATS to be <a href="../Misc/send-pr.html#appending">appended to the
PR</a>. "Many hands make light work."
<p>
Some problem reports are so trivial that the fix is obvious (or
perhaps the fix was provided by the submitter), that they go directly
from <b>open</b> to <b>closed</b> immediately after the fix is
committed.
<p>
If for some reason you find that you're unable to finish handling
the PR, reset the <b>&gt;Responsible:</b> field to whoever had
responsibility before you took the PR over.  Don't prevent others
from making progress on the PR because they think you're taking
care of it.
<p>
As long as you're marked as the Responsible Person for a PR,
you'll receive a monthly E-mail reminder about it. Use those
reminders to drive you to review PRs and put them into their correct
states as time passes.
<p>
When a PR is in <b>feedback</b> state, the PR submitter gets an
E-mail monthly reminder at the same time as the Responsible Persons
do, to prompt or prod them into responding. Generally, if there
has been no response for more than three months (three reminder
cycles), it's pretty safe to assume that the submitter is gone or
no longer cares.  At that point, whether to close the PR becomes
a judgement call for the Responsible Person - how serious is it?
Should it be solved without further input from the Submitter?
<p>
The other way we use the GNATS PR database is to keep track of
problems which are waiting for larger issues to be solved. The
oldest PR in the database at this writing, <a
href="http://www.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=13">lib/13</a>
(yes, of course it would be 13!) begs the entire internationalization
of the NetBSD system. I18N is a hard problem that requires a
wholesale overhaul of the system, which is why that PR is still
open after seven years. This doesn't mean we'll never solve it; just that
it isn't as critical as some other problems reported in the database.
<p>
In effect, this usage of the GNATS PR database is as a long-term
project tracking system.

<SECTION>Priorities, Severities, and Releases

<ENTRY>priorities Priorities, Severities, and Releases
In an ideal world, the GNATS PR database would be empty, we'd
release perfect software, and Microsoft would be a shadow of its
current self.
<p>
The <b>&gt;Priority:</b> field in the PR reflects this ideal,
in that <b>high</b> priority is supposed to be fixed immediately;
<b>medium</b> is supposed to be resolved before the next release
of NetBSD (major or minor?), and <b>low</b> priority gets solved
"eventually."
<p>
In practice, PR resolution is dependent on the right mix of
submitter interest, developer interest, problem reproduceability,
hardware availability, and good timing. If any of the required
elements is missing from the mix, the PR will sit.
<p>
If we were really diligent about PRs, we would adjust the priority
of each PR to reflect its actual importance, and probability of
getting fixed according to the definitions. Unfortunately, that
requires an overall evaluation of Release Engineering goals and
targets and all PRs relative to each other, which is difficult for
a dispersed group to do in an organized fashion.
<p>
In contrast, the <b>&gt;Severity:</b> field is really an expression
of the amount of pain the user is going through with the problem
being reported, and it's something we really shouldn't adjust
without careful consideration.
<p>
The proper procedure would be to review all PRs in the database
at each release point, to decide on a per-PR basis whether to "fix
now", "fix later", "suspend" and adjust priorities. Perhaps one
day we'll have the resources and manpower for that.
