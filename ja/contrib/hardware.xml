<title>CHRP (OpenfirmWare) based IBM RS/6000 Machines</title>
<para>
Tim Rightnour <email>garbled@NetBSD.org</email> would like to port
NetBSD/ofppc to any and all IBM CHRP-based RS/6000 machines.  These machines
are generally the black models.  Machine model codes that would be
particularly appreciated are:  7025-F50, 7026-*, 7028-*, 7044-*, 7043-260.
In all cases, prefer an SMP machine when available. POWER3, POWER4 or POWER5
would be a bonus.  Rackmount machines are acceptable, but need to be
operable with 120VAC.

<sect3 id="macppc">
<title>PowerPC Mac hardware</title>
<para>
Michael Lorenz <email>macallan@NetBSD.org</email> is interested in an
Old World Macintosh SMP machine, such as a PowerMac 9500/180MP to test macppc
SMP support on.  He is also interested in any G5 mac hardware, SMP preferred
if available.

Allen Briggs <email>briggs@ninthwonder.com</email> is interested in porting
NetBSD to Motorola m88110-based hardware such as the Data General AViiON.
Note that there are both 88100-based and 88110-based systems "out there"
and Allen already has some 88100-based hardware.

<title>SCSI bus analyzer</title>
<para>
Several ports could make use of a SCSI bus analyzer for debugging SCSI
drivers, developing new SCSI drivers, figuring out poorly or undocumented
hardware, and for improving existing performance of existing drivers.  An
analyzer that can work with old narrow SCSI/SCSI-2 busses is sufficient.
The intent is to share this among developers on an as-needed basis.  Contact
