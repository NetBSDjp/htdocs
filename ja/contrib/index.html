<p>
NetBSD is a non-profit volunteer organization that produces open source
software.  This means that the Project has no regular source of income,
instead relying on generous donations from third parties.

<p>
Funding for the NetBSD Project comes from a variety of sources.
<a href="org/">Organizations</a> and
<a href="donations.html">individuals</a> interested in NetBSD contribute
money, hardware and rack space to support important Project services, and
to enable developers to support new hardware platforms and peripherals.

<p>
In addition, some organizations and individuals contribute money and staff
for promotional events such as trade shows.  Some trade show organizers
also provide free or low-cost space.

<p>
It's important to understand that every donation matters.  Without servers
and rack space at colocation facilities, we would not be able to provide
high-quality centralized services such as revision control and
<a href="../MailingLists/">mailing lists</a>
to our developers and users.  Without donations of development hardware, we
would not be able to support the huge range of
<a href="../Ports/">platforms</a> and <a href="../Hardware/">peripherals</a>
we do today.  Without money and space to do promotional work, we would not
be able to present our work to other people and acquire new developers and
users.  Each of these functions is important to the ongoing health of the
Project.

<p>
So, whether you're a Fortune 100 company shipping NetBSD in a product, a
company running your web server on NetBSD, a home user with NetBSD on your
desktop, or just someone who thinks NetBSD is cool &#8212; or all four &#8212; please
consider donating something to the Project.

<h2>How you can help</h2>

<p>
The easiest way to donate is of course <a href="paypal.html">monetarily</a>.
For other ideas, read more about how an <a href="org/help.html">organization</a>
or <a href="howto.html">individual</a> can contribute.

<h2>Thanks to our past and ongoing contributors</h2>

We would like to thank the innumerable people who
have contributed time, code, documentation, financial or material aid to
the project, without whom NetBSD could not exist in the form it does today.
