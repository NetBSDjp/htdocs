<LIST>

<SECTION>The system

<ENTRY>feedback Use the system and make suggestions
First of all, NetBSD is a user supported project, so your <a
href="../Misc/feedback.html">feedback</a> is very welcome. This
includes comments, patches, new code as well as documentation. Feedback
can be given via the <a href="../Misc/send-pr.html">problem report
system</a>, and is also welcome on the various <a
href="../MailingLists/index.html">mailing lists</a>.

<ENTRY>report-bugs Report problems and suggestions
If you have any problems and suggestions, <em>please</em> submit them to our
<a href="../Misc/send-pr.html">problem report database</a>. You can either
use the send-pr(1) program installed on any NetBSD machine, or use the
<a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/sendpr.cgi?gndb=netbsd">online form</a>.
<p>
We cannot emphasise how important it is to use the problem report database -
if you just send the bug report or suggestion to a mail list it can fall
through the cracks.

<ENTRY>submit-fixes Submit fixes and code
Fixes and new code are passed into the same database as <a
href="#report-bugs">bug reports</a>. The database can  be browsed at
<pre>   <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Gnats/index.html">http://www.netbsd.org/Gnats/</a></pre>
There is plenty of work available in the database.  Don't worry that
you don't have commit access to the source tree yet; pick a problem to
analyze and work on, and submit the fix back in E-mail to <a
href="mailto:gnats-bugs@gnats.netbsd.org">&lt;gnats-bugs@gnats.netbsd.org&gt;</a>
with the Problem Report Number as the subject, and your contribution
will be automatically added to the problem report. The responsible
person(s) will review it, and if it looks good to them, probably will
commit the fix.  (Note that only the PR and the responsible person(s)
will receive a copy of your message.  Unless you explicitly send them a copy,
the submitter and other interested parties will not be automatically
sent a copy of your mail.)

<ENTRY>finance-support Finance specific support
If you are interested in paying for specific support or features, there are
a number of <a href="../gallery/consultants.html">consultants</a> available,
from drivers for specific hardware, to security, and systems integration.

<ENTRY>pkgsrc Third party packages
While most free software will compile on NetBSD 'out of the box',
the <a href="../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD packages
system</a> handles installation, dependencies and easy removal for
hundreds of packages.  If you find something not already covered
by the package system, maybe even contribute back the information
to make a package yourself. To contribute a package use the supplied
send-pr(1) command or <a
href="http://www.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/sendpr.cgi?gndb=netbsd">online
form</a>.

<SECTION>Donations (other pages)

<ENTRYLINK>hardware.html Hardware needed/available

<ENTRYLINK>donations.html Other donations


<SECTION>Online information
<ENTRY>emulation Emulation compatability page
As suggested by David Maxwell &lt;david@fundy.ca&gt;. We're interested in
collecting information on running programs under the various emulations NetBSD
provides, with a view to putting this up in an online database.

<ENTRY>www.netbsd.org The www.netbsd.org website
If you find anything out of place, or any suggestions for the www.netbsd.org
site, please <a href="../Misc/feedback.html">let us know!</a>

<ENTRY>mirror Maintain FTP mirror servers
If you have disk and bandwidth to donate, running a mirror FTP server
would be helpful.
The most important resource for mirrors is storage space,
full mirror will require 10Gbytes or more.
Contact <a href="mailto:mirrors@netbsd.org">&lt;mirrors@netbsd.org&gt;</a>
for more details.


<SECTION>Advocacy
<ENTRY>netbsd-advocacy netbsd-advocacy mail list
There is a <a
href="../MailingLists/index.html#netbsd-advocacy">netbsd-advocacy</a>
list specifically for discussion on promoting the NetBSD project
and the use and knowledge of NetBSD in general.

<ENTRY>hardware_vendors Web sites selling old and new hardware
As suggested by Erik E. Fair <a
href="mailto:fair@clock.org">&lt;fair@clock.org&gt;</a> and Joel
Reicher <a
href="mailto:joel@panacea.null.org">&lt;joel@panacea.null.org&gt;</a>.
Many vendors sell hardware, both old and new, but are unaware of the
fact it can run NetBSD. A link between their site and www.netbsd.org
can benefit both parties.

<ENTRY>seti The NetBSD seti@home group
<table><tr><td>
<a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a> is a
scientific experiment that will harness the power of hundreds of
thousands of Internet-connected computers in the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

</td></tr></table>
<p>
You can participate by running a
program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data. There's a
small but captivating possibility that your computer will detect the
faint murmur of a civilization beyond Earth. There is a specific <a
href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgi?cmd=team_lookup&name=NetBSD">NetBSD
group</a>, which you can join by selecting the 'Join this Group' link
at the top of that page.

<ENTRY>rc5 The NetBSD RC5 team
<table><tr><td>
<a href="mailto:explorer-rc5@flame.org">Michael Graff</a> set up a
NetBSD team at <a href="http://www.distributed.net/">distributed.net</a>
to work on the RSA labs RC5 and DES challenges

<p>
The client software computes a part of the keyspace, making use of the
spare cycles of your computer, running at the nicest CPU level. 
Under normal conditions, the only noticible effects of the client would
be the load average is &gt; 1 and the mails the client sends you from time
to time.
<p>
It would be nice, if you would also join our NetBSD team, even if you
don't run NetBSD on your computer.

<ENTRY>netbsd-logos Include a NetBSD logo on your site
If your web server runs on a NetBSD box, then why not include one of the
NetBSD logos.

<ENTRY>uptimes The Server Uptimes project
<a href="http://uptime.hexon.cx/">The Server Uptimes project</a>
collects statistics on server uptime for various operating systems.
The client runs on your server and sends an uptime report every few
minutes to the central server, which maintains the tables.
<p>
The client is available in pkgsrc as
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/net/upclient/README.html">net/upclient</a>, though systems with the highest uptimes are liable to be
running much older versions of NetBSD, and will probably need to download the
client direct from the project site.
