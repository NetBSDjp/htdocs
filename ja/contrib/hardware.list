<LIST>



<SECTION>Developers looking for machines

<ENTRY>r4000-decstation DECstation R4000: CPU, or entire machine
Toru Nishimura <nisimura@itc.aist-nara.ac.jp>
is intending on working on a mips64 port (similar to <a
href="../Ports/sparc64/">NetBSD/sparc64</a>) to utilize
64bit-ness of R4000 and above MIPS processors. To this end he needs to
upgrade his R3000 Personal DECstation, or secure any R4000 or better
DECstation.

<ENTRY>powerpc-laptop Macintosh PowerPC based laptops
Allen Briggs <briggs@canolog.ninthwonder.com> is looking to extend <a
href="../Ports/macppc/">NetBSD/macppc</a> support to
PowerPC-based laptops.

<ENTRY>sun3-470 Sun3/470 (CPU, RAM and any devices)
Jeremy Cooper <jeremy@netbsd.org> is looking for a Sun 3/470 so he can
complete the <a href="../Ports/sun3/">NetBSD/sun3</a>
port.  The machine is considered rather rare, so it's been difficult to
find one.  David Brownlee has graciously donated a 12 slot 9-U form factor
VME chassis to hold the machine.  Now Jeremy needs a CPU board, RAM, and
as many other VME devices as can be found.

<ENTRY>mvme-machines Motorola MVME Single Board computers
Steve Woodford <steve@mctavish.demon.co.uk> has recently ported NetBSD
to the 68040 based MVME-167 board. He would like to continue to expand
the <a href="../Ports/mvme68k/">mvme68k</a> port. In
particular he is interested in any of:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/WebOS/omf/GSS/MCG/products/overview.html?[prodid=MVME162">MVME162</a> or MVME166 (68040)
<li><a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/WebOS/omf/GSS/MCG/products/overview.html?[prodid=MVME172">MVME172</a> or <a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/WebOS/omf/GSS/MCG/products/overview.html?[prodid=MVME177">MVME177</a> (68060)
</ul>
with the proviso that they have at least 8Mb of RAM and an ethernet
controller (some models have no ethernet/scsi). He can live without scsi
initially.
<p>
If someone wants to donate/loan one of the above boards he would prefer if
it is a model which is compatible with the MVME712 transition module,
unless that someone is also loaning/donating the specific transition
module for the board.

<ENTRY>m88k Data General AViiON or other m88k based machine
Allen Briggs <briggs@canolog.ninthwonder.com> if interested in porting
NetBSD to Motorola m88k hardware such as the Data General AViiON.

<ENTRY>mips-arc ARC compliant MIPS machine
Noriyuki Soda <soda@netbsd.org> is working on NetBSD/arc, but is
handicapped by his host being a very flaky preproduction unit. Having a
(dependable) ARC box would help expediate both of NetBSD/arc and
NetBSD/mips64 projects.

<ENTRY>turbochannel-alpha TURBOchannel based Alpha machine
Jonathan Stone <jonathan@DSG.Stanford.EDU>
would benefit from a TURBOchannel based Alpha machine to ensure any
changes he makes to the TURBOchannel code for <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a> do not impact <a
href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a>.



<SECTION>Developers looking for other hardware

<ENTRY>turbochannel-pmag-j TURBOchannel PMAG-J graphics card
Jonathan Stone <jonathan@DSG.Stanford.EDU> would be happy to test a
loaner PMAG-J and do any necessary development for <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>.  Longer-term, we
really need one in a developer's hands for release testing and
development.  Donation of a PMAG-J would be much appreciated.

<ENTRY>scsi-disks SCSI disks
The NetBSD build lab is looking for several &gt;1GB SCSI drives for the
NFS server. Contact <a href="mailto:hpeyerl@netbsd.org">Herb Peyerl</a>.



<SECTION>Hardware available to anyone who would like to write support

<ENTRY>precedence-nc Precedence NC
Stephen Borrill <netbsd@precedence.co.uk>, would be willing to loan
a <a href="http://www.precedence.co.uk/products/nc.html">Precedence
NC</a> to anyone interested in working on a port. <a
href="../Ports/arm32/">NetBSD/arm32</a> already supports similar
machines and the work should be minimal.
<ul>
<li>48MHz ARM 7500FE
<li>PS/2 keyboard and mouse
<li>16-bit audio
<li>No floppy or hard disc interface
<li>2 serial ports connected to IR and Smart card.
<li>Parallel port
<li>16MB EDO RAM
<li>EtherN network card (ne0 device) with 1Mbit flash
<li>NCOS 1.xx
</ul>
[1999-12-14].

<ENTRY>performa-5320 Performa-5320 - Non open firmware Power Mac
Bob Nestor <rnestor@metronet.com> would be willing to loan his
Performa-5320 All-in-One for anyone interested in working on porting <a
href="../Ports/macppc/">NetBSD/macppc</a> to non open
firmware Power Macintosh hardware.

<ul>
<li>Performa-5320 All-in-One
<li>non-PCI (nubus)
<li>117Mhz 603 CPU
<li>32MB RAM
<li>1.6GB IDE harddrive (Could be swapped for 8.4GB unit)
<li>15" built in display
<li>10BaseT Ethernet, 28.8K internal modem, SCSI controller.
</ul>
[19990502]

<ENTRY>sun386i Sun 386i with mono monitor (Vancouver)
Curt Sampson <cjs@cynic.net> has a Sun386i available to anyone
interested in working on a port:
<ul>
<li>Sun 386i model 250.
<li>4MB RAM, upgradable via 1MB 30pin simms (max 16MB).
<li>100-200MB internal SCSI drive.
<li>3.5" floppy drive (1.44MB).
<li>19" Monochrome monitor.
<li>AUI ethernet, serial, parallel.
<li>Keyboard, mouse.
<li>Last available SunOS version 4.0.2.
</ul>
The port should be able to leverage much of the work already done for
<a href="../Ports/sparc/">NetBSD/sparc</a>,
<a href="../Ports/sun3/">NetBSD/sun3</a>, and
<a href="../Ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386</a>.
The machine would need to be picked up from Vancouver, Canada. [19990502]

<ENTRY>mips-magnum MIPS Magnum 4000PC-50 (Vancouver)
Curt Sampson <cjs@cynic.net> has a MIPS Magnum 4000PC-50 available to
anyone interested in helping with NetBSD/arc.
<ul>
<li>MIPS R4k CPU
<li>ARC BIOS
<li>8 72-pin SIMM slots, requires them filled in banks of 4 with parity RAM
<li>On-board controllers for SCSI, floppy, Ethernet (AUI), and sound.
<li>Usual PC style hardware and EISA slots.
</ul>
Noriyuki Soda <soda@netbsd.org> is already working on NetBSD/arc.  The
machine would need to be picked up from Vancouver, Canada. [19990502]

<ENTRY>tc-alpha-3000 Turbochannel alpha with framebuffers
Peter C. Wallace <pcw@mesanet.com> is willing to donate an alpha
3000/400 with a selection of turbochannel framebuffers (PMAGB-B,
PMAG-C, PMAG-E), 64MB ram, 1 or 2 1GB disks, keyboard and mouse,
to anyone interested in working on turbochannel console and X
support for <a href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a>.
(There is already support under <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>). The machine can
probably be shipped to anywhere in the US . [19991101];

<ENTRY>tc-pmagd Turbochannel PMAG-D framebuffer
Wilko Bulte <wilko@yedi.iaf.nl> has a Turbochannel PMAG-D framebuffer
available to any developer interested in helping to get this card
supported under <a href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a>.
(It is already supported on <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>). The card can
probably be shipped just about anywhere. [19991101];

<ENTRY>isa-arcnet ISA Arcnet cards
David Brownlee <abs@netbsd.org> has (for unknown reasons) two 8bit ISA
Arcnet cards going begging to anyone interested in writing support for
NetBSD. Arcnet is already supported under <a
href="../Ports/amiga/">NetBSD/amiga</a>, and there
<em>may</em> be existing linux drivers out there.

<ENTRY>isa-interlan ISA Interlan ethernet cards
David Brownlee <abs@netbsd.org> also has several 8 bit NI5210/8
Interlan ethernet cards, with AUI and 10baseT interfaces. The cards use
an intel 82586 chip. There is already a driver for that chip in the
tree, so it should be a case of writing a new attach and front end
routines. Will send a pair of cards to anyone who would like to work on
this driver.

use it?<BR>
[1999-12-17]

<ENTRY>decstation-3100 DECstation 3100
Gordon Zaft <zaft@azstarnet.com> has a spare DECstation 3100. He is in
