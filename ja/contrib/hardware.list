<LIST>



<SECTION>Developers looking for machines

<ENTRY>mvme-machines Motorola MVME Single Board computers
Steve Woodford <steve@mctavish.co.uk> has recently ported NetBSD
to the 68040 based MVME-167 and MVME-162LX 200/300 series of boards.
He would like to continue to expand
the <a href="../Ports/mvme68k/">mvme68k</a> port. In
particular he is interested in any of:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=16&amp;ProductID=2&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME162</a> or MVME166 (68040)
<li><a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=239&amp;ProductID=4&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME172</a> or <a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=238&amp;ProductID=5&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME177</a> (68060)
</ul>
with the proviso that they have at least 8Mb of RAM and an ethernet
controller (some models have no ethernet/scsi). He can live without scsi
initially.
<p>
If someone wants to donate/loan one of the above boards he would prefer if
it is a model which is compatible with the MVME712 transition module,
unless that someone is also loaning/donating the specific transition
module for the board.

<ENTRY>m88110-hardware m88110-based Data General AViiON
Allen Briggs <briggs@ninthwonder.com> if interested in porting
NetBSD to Motorola m88110-based hardware such as the Data General AViiON.
Note that there are both 88100-based and 88110-based systems "out there"
and Allen already has some 88100-based hardware.

<ENTRY>mips-arc ARC compliant MIPS machine
Noriyuki Soda <soda@netbsd.org> is working on NetBSD/arc, but is
handicapped by his host being a very flaky preproduction unit. Having a
(dependable) ARC box would help expediate both of NetBSD/arc and
NetBSD/mips64 projects.

<ENTRY>tc-alpha TURBOchannel based Alpha machine
Jonathan Stone <jonathan@DSG.Stanford.EDU>
would benefit from a TURBOchannel based Alpha machine to ensure any
changes he makes to the TURBOchannel code for <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a> do not impact <a
href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a>.



<SECTION>Developers looking for other hardware

<ENTRY>tc-pmag-j TURBOchannel PMAG-J graphics card
Jonathan Stone <jonathan@DSG.Stanford.EDU> would be happy to test a
loaner PMAG-J and do any necessary development for <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>.  Longer-term, we
really need one in a developer's hands for release testing and
development.  Donation of a PMAG-J would be much appreciated.

<ENTRY>scsi-disks SCSI disks
The NetBSD build lab is looking for several &gt;1GB SCSI drives for the
NFS server. Contact <a href="mailto:hpeyerl@netbsd.org">Herb Peyerl</a>.

<ENTRY>scsi-analyzer SCSI bus analyzer
Several ports could make use of a SCSI bus analyzer for debugging
SCSI drivers, developing new SCSI drivers, figuring out poorly or
undocumented hardware, and for improving existing performance of
existing drivers.  An analyzer that can work with old narrow
SCSI/SCSI-2 busses is sufficient.  The intent is to share this
among developers on an as-needed basis.  Contact
<a href="mailto:briggs@netbsd.org">Allen Briggs</a>.

<ENTRY>sparc10-cpu-wanted Sun SPARCstation 10/41 CPU wanted
Hubert Feyrer &lt;hubertf@netbsd.org&gt; is looking for a second
CPU for his SS10/41. The system is currently equipped with a
501-2270 CPU, and a second CPU of either this kind or 501-2258 or
501-2359 would be appreciated to help preparing pkgsrc for SMP.

<ENTRY>mca-cards-wanted MCA cards and documentation wanted
If you have some MCA (Micro-Channel Architecture, also referred to as only MC)
cards in your junk pile you'd be willing to give away, please contact
Jaromir Dolecek
&lt;<a href="mailto:jdolecek@NetBSD.org">jdolecek@NetBSD.org</a>&gt;.
He is collecting them, so that drivers for the cards could be written,
tested and added to the NetBSD tree. More information (as well as
list of most wanted hardware) is at the
<a href="../Ports/i386/ps2.html">NetBSD on IBM PS/2</a> page.

<SECTION>Hardware available to anyone who would like to write support

<ENTRY>powerstation320 IBM POWERstation 320, model 7012 RS/6000
Dave Camp <freemalloc@yahoo.com>, would be willing to give an IBM
POWERstation 320, model 7012 RS/6000, to anyone who would like to port NetBSD 
to it. It was reported to be fully functional up until the hard drive crashed.
This system is located near the San Francisco Bay area.
[20000218]

<ENTRY>diab-ds90 DIAB DS90/20 workstation
Iggy Drougge <a href="mailto:optimus@canit.se">&lt;optimus@canit.se&gt;</a>
has a DIAB DS90/20 (68020/68581/68881/ 8450/misc. Zilog) which is
available to anyone interested in <a href="../Ports/#diab-ds90">porting
NetBSD to the DIAB DS90 machines</a>.
[20011024]

<ENTRY>arm26-machines Acorn arm26 machines
Kjetil B. Thomassen <kjetil@thomassen.priv.no> has a couple of Acorn
A310 and an R140 ARM2/3 based machines he would be willing to lend for
an indefinite time to anyone interested in working on a port.
<ul>
<li>ARM2 / ARM3 26bit CPUs.
<li>4MB RAM.
<li>Acorn VIDC and IOC chipset.
<li>Serial, parallel, ST506, keyboard, and mouse interfaces.
<li>SVGA-like monitor interface (chipset is definitely not SVGA).
<li>Acorn 'podule' bus interface - can take IDE and SCSI cards.
</ul>
The R140 can run RISCiX, Acorn's own BSD gcc using BSD 4.3-port, which it
might be possible to leverage.
[20000107]

<ENTRY>performa-5320 Performa-5320 - Non open firmware Power Mac
Bob Nestor <rnestor@metronet.com> would be willing to loan his
Performa-5320 All-in-One for anyone interested in working on porting <a
href="../Ports/macppc/">NetBSD/macppc</a> to non open
firmware Power Macintosh hardware.
<ul>
<li>Performa-5320 All-in-One
<li>non-PCI (nubus)
<li>117Mhz 603 CPU
<li>32MB RAM
<li>1.6GB IDE harddrive (Could be swapped for 8.4GB unit)
<li>15" built in display
<li>10BaseT Ethernet, 28.8K internal modem, SCSI controller.
</ul>

<ENTRY>mips-magnum MIPS Magnum 4000PC-50 (Vancouver)
Curt Sampson <cjs@cynic.net> has a MIPS Magnum 4000PC-50 available to
anyone interested in helping with NetBSD/arc.
<ul>
<li>MIPS R4k CPU
<li>ARC BIOS
<li>8 72-pin SIMM slots, requires them filled in banks of 4 with parity RAM
<li>On-board controllers for SCSI, floppy, Ethernet (AUI), and sound.
<li>Usual PC style hardware and EISA slots.
</ul>
Noriyuki Soda <soda@netbsd.org> is already working on NetBSD/arc.  The
machine would need to be picked up from Vancouver, Canada. [19990502]

<ENTRY>tc-pmagd TURBOchannel PMAG-D framebuffer
Wilko Bulte <wilko@yedi.iaf.nl> has a TURBOchannel PMAG-D framebuffer
available to any developer interested in helping to get this card
supported under <a href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a>.
(It is already supported on <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>). The card can
probably be shipped just about anywhere. [19991101];

<ENTRY>isa-arcnet ISA Arcnet cards
David Brownlee <abs@netbsd.org> has (for unknown reasons) two 8bit ISA
Arcnet cards that he'll donate to anyone interested in writing support for
NetBSD. Arcnet is already supported under <a
href="../Ports/amiga/">NetBSD/amiga</a>, and there
<em>may</em> be existing linux drivers out there.

<ENTRY>isa-interlan ISA Interlan ethernet cards
David Brownlee <abs@netbsd.org> also has several 8 bit NI5210/8
Interlan ethernet cards, with AUI and 10baseT interfaces. The cards use
an intel 82586 chip. There is already a driver for that chip in the
tree, so it should be a case of writing a new attach and front end
routines. Will send a pair of cards to anyone who would like to work on
this driver.

<ENTRY>olivetti-esc Olivetti ESC-I and ESC-II EISA SCSI adapters
Francesco Messineo <frank@ideare.com> has Olivetti ESC-I and ESC-II
EISA SCSI adapters, available to anyone who would like to write a
driver for them.

<ENTRY>eisa-sync DNSES EISA Synchronous Communications Controller
oskar@unna.ping.de (Jan-Hinrich Fessel) has a
DNSES EISA Synchronous Communications Controller
with minimal docs (i.e. pinout and install guide)
for anyone who is willing to do a port for it.
It supports V.35@64kb V.24/V.28@19.2kb V.11/V.36@E1/T1 and V.10@64kb.

<ENTRY>eisa-compaq-ether-token Compaq NetFlex-2 ENET-TR card
lloyd.parkes@eds.com (Parkes, Lloyd) has a Compaq NetFlex-2 ENET-TR card,
which is an EISA card that combines ethernet and tokenring interfaces.
He is happy to send it to anybody who is keen on writing EISA drivers.
