<LIST>



<SECTION>Developers looking for machines

<ENTRY>mvme-machines Motorola MVME Single Board computers
Steve Woodford <steve@mctavish.co.uk> has recently extended NetBSD/mvme68k
to support the high-end variants of Motorola's MVME68K boards.
He would like to continue to expand
the <a href="../Ports/mvme68k/">mvme68k</a> port. In
particular he is interested in any of:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=16&amp;ProductID=2&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME162</a> or MVME166 (68040)
<li><a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=239&amp;ProductID=4&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME172</a> or <a href="http://www.mcg.mot.com/cfm/templates/product.cfm?PageID=238&amp;ProductID=5&amp;PageTypeID=1">MVME177</a> (68060)
</ul>
with the proviso that they have at least 8Mb of RAM and an ethernet
controller (some models have no ethernet/scsi). He can live without scsi
initially.
<p>
In addition, he would be interested in donations of any Motorola PowerPC
MVME boards in order to extend the NetBSD/mvmeppc port.
<p>
If someone wants to donate/loan one of the above boards he would prefer if
it is a model which is compatible with the MVME712 transition module,
unless that someone is also loaning/donating the specific transition
module for the board.

<ENTRY>m88110-hardware m88110-based Data General AViiON
Allen Briggs <briggs@ninthwonder.com> is interested in porting
NetBSD to Motorola m88110-based hardware such as the Data General AViiON.
Note that there are both 88100-based and 88110-based systems "out there"
and Allen already has some 88100-based hardware.

<ENTRY>mips-arc ARC compliant MIPS machine
Noriyuki Soda <soda@netbsd.org> is working on <a href="../Ports/arc/">NetBSD/arc</a>, but is
handicapped by his host being a very flaky preproduction unit. Having a
(dependable) ARC box would help expediate both of <a href="../Ports/arc/">NetBSD/arc</a> and
<a href="../Ports/#suggested-mips">NetBSD/mips64</a> projects.

<ENTRY>tc-alpha TURBOchannel based Alpha machine
Jonathan Stone <jonathan@DSG.Stanford.EDU>
would benefit from a TURBOchannel based Alpha machine to ensure any
changes he makes to the TURBOchannel code for <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a> do not impact <a
href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a>.


<SECTION>Developers looking for other hardware

<ENTRY>tc-pmag-j TURBOchannel PMAG-J graphics card
Jonathan Stone <jonathan@DSG.Stanford.EDU> would be happy to test a
loaner PMAG-J and do any necessary development for <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>.  Longer-term, we
really need one in a developer's hands for release testing and
development.  Donation of a PMAG-J would be much appreciated.

<ENTRY>scsi-disks SCSI disks
The NetBSD build lab is looking for several &gt;1GB SCSI drives for the
NFS server. Contact <a href="mailto:hpeyerl@netbsd.org">Herb Peyerl</a>.

<ENTRY>scsi-analyzer SCSI bus analyzer
Several ports could make use of a SCSI bus analyzer for debugging
SCSI drivers, developing new SCSI drivers, figuring out poorly or
undocumented hardware, and for improving existing performance of
existing drivers.  An analyzer that can work with old narrow
SCSI/SCSI-2 busses is sufficient.  The intent is to share this
among developers on an as-needed basis.  Contact
<a href="mailto:briggs@netbsd.org">Allen Briggs</a>.

<ENTRY>mca-cards-wanted MCA cards and documentation wanted
If you have some MCA (Micro-Channel Architecture, also referred to as only MC)
cards in your junk pile you'd be willing to give away, please contact
Jaromir Dolecek
&lt;<a href="mailto:jdolecek@NetBSD.org">jdolecek@NetBSD.org</a>&gt;.
He is collecting them, so that drivers for the cards could be written,
tested and added to the NetBSD tree. More information (as well as
list of most wanted hardware) is at the
<a href="../Ports/i386/ps2.html">NetBSD on IBM PS/2</a> page.

<SECTION>Hardware available to anyone who would like to write support

<ENTRY>jornada820 HP Jornada 820
Armijn Hemel <armijn@nl.linux.org> is willing to loan out a HP Jornada
820 (StrongARM 1100, 16 MB RAM, PCMCIA slot, CompactFlash II slot,
Windows CE Professional in ROM, Dutch and/or English power adapter)
for porting NetBSD.
The offer is valid for a limited time and he strongly prefers not to
send it outside of the Netherlands. The machine is located in Utrecht.
[20030122]

<ENTRY>rs6000-7011-model250 IBM RS/6000 type 7011, model 250
The machine Armijn Hemel <armijn@nl.linux.org> wants to find a home
for has a MCA bus, 32 MB of memory (soon to be upgraded to 48 MB), a 66 Mhz
PowerPC CPU, on-board Ethernet and contains 2 MCA cards: 3COM 00G3368
(with AUI and BNC) and a 16-port serial card (including a
box with connectors for the card). The case is slightly bent.
There is no floppy drive and no graphics card and he is unsure of the size of
the internal disk because he hasn't tried to turn it on and run the
installed AIX, yet. 
Pickup in the Netherlands (near Utrecht) preferred.
[20030122]

<ENTRY>powerstation320 IBM POWERstation 320, model 7012 RS/6000
Dave Camp <freemalloc@yahoo.com> would be willing to give an IBM
POWERstation 320, model 7012 RS/6000, to anyone who would like to port NetBSD 
to it. It was reported to be fully functional up until the hard drive crashed.
This system is located near the San Francisco Bay area.
[20000218]

<ENTRY>diab-ds90 DIAB DS90/20 workstation

available to anyone interested in <a href="../Ports/#diab-ds90">porting
NetBSD to the DIAB DS90 machines</a>.
[20011024]

<ENTRY>arm26-machines Acorn arm26 machines
Kjetil B. Thomassen <kjetil@thomassen.priv.no> has a couple of Acorn
A310 and an R140 ARM2/3 based machines he would be willing to lend for
an indefinite time to anyone interested in working on a port.
<ul>
<li>ARM2 / ARM3 26bit CPUs.
<li>4MB RAM.
<li>Acorn VIDC and IOC chipset.
<li>Serial, parallel, ST506, keyboard, and mouse interfaces.
<li>SVGA-like monitor interface (chipset is definitely not SVGA).
<li>Acorn 'podule' bus interface - can take IDE and SCSI cards.
</ul>
The R140 can run RISCiX, Acorn's own BSD gcc using BSD 4.3-port, which it
might be possible to leverage.
[20000107]

<ENTRY>tc-pmagd TURBOchannel PMAG-D framebuffer
Wilko Bulte <wilko@yedi.iaf.nl> has a TURBOchannel PMAG-D framebuffer
available to any developer interested in helping to get this card
supported under <a href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a>.
(It is already supported on <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>). The card can
probably be shipped just about anywhere. [19991101];

<ENTRY>isa-arcnet ISA Arcnet cards
David Brownlee <abs@netbsd.org> has (for unknown reasons) two 8bit ISA
Arcnet cards that he'll donate to anyone interested in writing support for
NetBSD. Arcnet is already supported under <a
href="../Ports/amiga/">NetBSD/amiga</a>, and there
<em>may</em> be existing linux drivers out there.

<ENTRY>isa-interlan ISA Interlan ethernet cards
David Brownlee <abs@netbsd.org> also has several 8 bit NI5210/8
Interlan ethernet cards, with AUI and 10baseT interfaces. The cards use
an intel 82586 chip. There is already a driver for that chip in the
tree, so it should be a case of writing a new attach and front end
routines. Will send a pair of cards to anyone who would like to work on
this driver.

<ENTRY>olivetti-esc Olivetti ESC-I and ESC-II EISA SCSI adapters
Francesco Messineo <frank@ideare.com> has Olivetti ESC-I and ESC-II
