If you have hardware you could donate or loan to a NetBSD developer, or
are interested in writing a driver and just need the hardware, this is
the place to check. Each entry has a contact email address.
Please cc <www@NetBSD.org>, so we can update this page.

If you have anything you would like to add to this list, please <a

<LIST>



<SECTION>Developers looking for machines

<ENTRY>cobalt-raq Cobalt RAQ2 and QUBE
Simon Burge <simonb@wasabisystems.com> would like to improve support
for the mips r5k based Cobalt RAQ2 and QUBE.  In particular he is
interested in investigating the cache and pci stability issues and
the firmware restriction on max image size.

He is based in Australia and would be willing to help cover shipping.


<ENTRY>m88110-hardware m88110-based Data General AViiON
Allen Briggs <briggs@ninthwonder.com> is interested in porting
NetBSD to Motorola m88110-based hardware such as the Data General AViiON.
Note that there are both 88100-based and 88110-based systems "out there"
and Allen already has some 88100-based hardware.

<ENTRY>mips-arc ARC compliant MIPS machine
Noriyuki Soda <soda@NetBSD.org> is working on <a href="../Ports/arc/">NetBSD/arc</a>, but is
handicapped by his host being a very flaky preproduction unit. Having a
(dependable) ARC box would help expediate both of <a href="../Ports/arc/">NetBSD/arc</a> and
<a href="../Ports/#suggested-mips">NetBSD/mips64</a> projects.

<ENTRY>tc-alpha TURBOchannel based Alpha machine
Jonathan Stone <jonathan@DSG.Stanford.EDU>
would benefit from a TURBOchannel based Alpha machine to ensure any
changes he makes to the TURBOchannel code for <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a> do not impact <a
href="../Ports/alpha/">NetBSD/alpha</a>.


<SECTION>Developers looking for other hardware

<ENTRY>tc-pmag-j TURBOchannel PMAG-J graphics card
Jonathan Stone <jonathan@DSG.Stanford.EDU> would be happy to test a
loaner PMAG-J and do any necessary development for <a
href="../Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>.  Longer-term, we
really need one in a developer's hands for release testing and
development.  Donation of a PMAG-J would be much appreciated.

<ENTRY>scsi-disks SCSI disks
The NetBSD build lab is looking for several &gt;1GB SCSI drives for the
NFS server. Contact <a href="mailto:hpeyerl@NetBSD.org">Herb Peyerl</a>.

<ENTRY>scsi-analyzer SCSI bus analyzer
Several ports could make use of a SCSI bus analyzer for debugging
SCSI drivers, developing new SCSI drivers, figuring out poorly or
undocumented hardware, and for improving existing performance of
existing drivers.  An analyzer that can work with old narrow
SCSI/SCSI-2 busses is sufficient.  The intent is to share this
among developers on an as-needed basis.  Contact
<a href="mailto:briggs@NetBSD.org">Allen Briggs</a>.

<ENTRY>mca-cards-wanted MCA cards and documentation wanted
If you have some MCA (Micro-Channel Architecture, also referred to as only MC)
cards in your junk pile you'd be willing to give away, please contact
Jaromir Dolecek
&lt;<a href="mailto:jdolecek@NetBSD.org">jdolecek@NetBSD.org</a>&gt;.
He is collecting them, so that drivers for the cards could be written,
tested and added to the NetBSD tree. More information (as well as
list of most wanted hardware) is at the
<a href="../Ports/i386/ps2.html">NetBSD on IBM PS/2</a> page.

<SECTION>Hardware available to anyone who would like to write support

<!-- shipped on Fri, 7 Feb 2003 to Noud de Brouwer -->

< ENTRY >jornada820 HP Jornada 820
Armijn Hemel <armijn@nl.linux.org> is willing to loan out a HP Jornada
820 (StrongARM 1100, 16 MB RAM, PCMCIA slot, CompactFlash II slot,
Windows CE Professional in ROM, Dutch and/or English power adapter)
for porting NetBSD.
The offer is valid for a limited time and he strongly prefers not to
send it outside of the Netherlands. The machine is located in Utrecht.

<ENTRY>rs6000-7011-model250 IBM RS/6000 type 7011, model 250
The machine Armijn Hemel <armijn@nl.linux.org> wants to find a home
for has a MCA bus, 32 MB of memory (soon to be upgraded to 48 MB), a 66 Mhz
PowerPC CPU, on-board Ethernet and contains 2 MCA cards: 3COM 00G3368
(with AUI and BNC) and a 16-port serial card (including a
box with connectors for the card). The case is slightly bent.
There is no floppy drive and no graphics card and he is unsure of the size of
the internal disk because he hasn't tried to turn it on and run the
installed AIX, yet. 
Pickup in the Netherlands (near Utrecht) preferred.
[20030122]

<ENTRY>powerstation320 IBM POWERstation 320, model 7012 RS/6000

the kernel or pkgsrc might want an actual Sparc to test on.  They're $30 to
ship UPS ground (the 10's weigh less) or they can be picked up in the Phoenix,
Arizona, USA area.  The hardware is free to anyone who has done development on
BSD in the past or can be recognized to be associated with the project.
