<h1><A NAME="page-top">NetBSD Problem Report States</A></h1>

<P>
Each PR goes through a defined series of states between origination and
closure. The submitter of a PR receives notification automatically via E-mail of
any state changes.</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="open"><STRONG>open</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>The initial state of a Problem Report. This means the PR has been filed
and the responsible person(s) notified.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="analyzed"><STRONG>analyzed</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>The responsible person has analyzed the problem. The analysis should
contain a preliminary evaluation of the problem and an estimate of the
amount of time and resources necessary to solve the problem. It should
also suggest possible workarounds.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="feedback"><STRONG>feedback</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>The problem has been solved, and the submitter has been given a patch
or other fix.  The PR remains in this state until the submitter
acknowledges that the solution works.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="closed"><STRONG>closed</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>A Problem Report is closed ("the bug stops here") only when any
changes have been integrated, documented, and tested, and the submitter
has confirmed the solution.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="suspended"><STRONG>suspended</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>Work on the problem has been postponed. This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time.
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being actively
sought. If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.</DD>
