<h1><a name="page-top">NetBSD Problem Report States</a></h1>

<p>
Each PR goes through a defined series of states between origination and
closure. The submitter of a PR receives notification automatically via E-mail of
any state changes.
<p>

<big><b><a name="open">open</a></b></big>
<blockquote>
The initial state of a Problem Report. This means the PR has been filed
and the responsible person(s) notified.
</blockquote>

<big><b><a name="analyzed">analyzed</a></b></big>
<blockquote>
The responsible person has analyzed the problem. The analysis should
contain a preliminary evaluation of the problem and an estimate of the
amount of time and resources necessary to solve the problem. It should
also suggest possible workarounds.
</blockquote>

<big><b><a name="feedback">feedback</a></b></big>
<blockquote>
The problem has been solved, and the submitter has been given a patch
or other fix.  The PR remains in this state until the submitter
acknowledges that the solution works.
</blockquote>

<big><b><a name="closed">closed</a></b></big>
<blockquote>
A Problem Report is closed ("the bug stops here") only when any
changes have been integrated, documented, and tested, and the submitter
has confirmed the solution.
</blockquote>

<big><b><a name="suspended">suspended</a></b></big>
<blockquote>
Work on the problem has been postponed. This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time.
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being actively
sought. If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.
