<h2>What is the NetBSD Project?</h2>

<p>
The NetBSD Project is an international collaborative effort of a
<a href="../People/">large group of people</a>, to produce a
<a href="../Goals/redistribution.html">freely
available and redistributable</a>
<a href="call-it-a-duck.html">UNIX-like</a> operating system,
<b>NetBSD</b>.
In addition to our own work,
NetBSD contains a variety of other free software, including
<b>4.4BSD Lite</b> from the <b>University of California, Berkeley</b>.

<p>
For more information, see the <a href="features.html">NetBSD features page</a>,
some <a href="../gallery/in-Action/">screenshots</a> 
or go directly to the 
<a href="../Releases/">download</a> section if you're impatient.

<p>
One of the primary focuses of the NetBSD project has been to make the
base OS
<a href="../Goals/portability.html">extremely portable</a>.  This has
resulted in NetBSD being ported to a large number of
<a href="../Ports/">hardware platforms</a>.  NetBSD is also
<a href="../Goals/interop.html">highly interoperable</a>, implementing
many standard APIs and network protocols, and emulating many other systems'
ABIs.

<p>
NetBSD is distributed in three forms:
<a href="../Releases/formal.html">formal releases</a>,
<a href="../Releases/release-map.html#NetBSD-release">NetBSD-release</a>, and
<a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>.
Formal releases are done periodically and include well-tested
binaries, source code, and installation tools.  NetBSD-release is
a daily updated snapshot of the release branch, which normally will
become the next patch release. NetBSD-current is a nightly distribution
of the latest development sources, meant for people who want the
absolute latest software, and don't mind an occasional bug.

<p>
NetBSD is largely supported by users, via Usenet newsgroups,
<a href="../MailingLists/">mailing lists</a>, and
<a href="../contrib/">direct contributions</a>.
If you're having a problem, it's likely that someone will have seen it
before and will be able to help you.

<p>
The <a href="../Foundation/">NetBSD Foundation</a>
is intended to be a tax exempt, not-for-profit corporation, that
shall devote itself to the traditional goals and Spirit
of the NetBSD Project and own the trademark of the word "NetBSD".

<p>
<big><b>Why the name?</b></big>

<p>
The `BSD' in our name is an obvious recognition of our heritage as a
derivative of <b>4.4BSD</b> and <b>386BSD</b>.

<p>
Our contributors communicate primarily via email and Internet-based chat
systems; many of us have never met each other in person.  We also use a
remote source code management system called
<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a> which enables a
large number of developers to do independent work on the same source tree
easily.
We believe that the Internet was an enabling technology that made NetBSD
possible.  The `net' in our name was thus chosen as a tribute to the
Internet.
