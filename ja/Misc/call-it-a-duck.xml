If something looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks
like a duck, what is it?
</para>

<para>
The answer, of course, depends on whether or not the name `duck'
is a trademark!  If it is, then the closest that something can get,
without permission of the owner of the trademark, is `duck-like.'
</para>

<para>
`UNIX' is a trademark of <ulink url="http://www.opengroup.org/">The Open
Group</ulink>, and NetBSD has not been branded with that trademark.
Therefore, <emphasis role="bold">NetBSD is not UNIX</emphasis>.  We refer to
it as `UNIX-like' or `UN*X-like.'
