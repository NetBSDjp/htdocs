<p>
A database is only as good as the data that goes into it.
In general, common sense (assuming such an animal exists) dictates the
kind of information that would be most helpful in tracking down and
resolving problems in software.</P>
<p>

<h2><a name="general-advice">General Advice</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Include anything <em>you</em> would want to know if you were
looking at the report from the other end. There's no need to include
every minute detail about your environment, although anything that
might be different from someone else's environment should be included
(your path, for instance).
<p>

<li>Narratives are often useful, given a certain degree of
restraint. If a person responsible for a bug can see that A was
executed, and then B and then C, knowing that sequence of events
might trigger the realization of an intermediate step that was
missing, or an extra step that might have changed the environment
enough to cause a visible problem. Again, restraint is always in
order ("I set the build running, went to get a cup of coffee
(Columbian, cream but no sugar), talked to Sheila on the phone,
and then THIS happened...") but be sure to include anything
relevant.
<p>

<li>Richard Stallman writes,
<blockquote>
The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
<strong>report all the facts.</strong>
If you are not sure whether to state a fact or leave it out, state it!
</blockquote>
This holds true across all problem reporting systems, for computer
software or social injustice or motorcycle maintenance. It is
especially important in the software field due to the major
differences seemingly insignificant changes can make (a changed
variable, a missing semicolon, etc.).
<p>

<li>Submit only <em>one</em> problem with each Problem Report.
If you have multiple problems, use multiple PRs. This aids in
tracking each problem and also in analyzing the problems associated
with a given program.
<p>

<li>It never hurts to do a little research to find out if the
bug you've found has already been reported. Most software releases
contain lists of known bugs in the Release Notes which come with
the software. In addition, it's a good idea to
<a href="query-pr.html">search the NetBSD GNATS problem report database</a>
to see if someone already reported the problem you're having (who knows?
there might already be a fix or work-around in the database).
<p>

<li>The more closely a PR adheres to the standard format, the
less interaction is required by a database administrator to route
the information to the proper place. Keep in mind that anything
that requires human interaction also requires time that might be
better spent in actually fixing the problem. It is therefore in
everyone's best interest that the information contained in a PR be
as correct as possible (in both format and content) at the time of
submission. See <a href="pr-fields.html">a description of the fields</a> in a 
problem report for more details.

<h2><a name="kernel-panic">When Reporting a Kernel Panic</a></h2>

<p>
So, the kernel panic'd, and gave you a whole lot of hexadecimal numbers,
and halted.
It's important for you to report this event,
since real operating systems should never crash or panic,
unless the computer hardware fails egregiously
(there's usually not much an OS can do about hardware failure).
That leaves kernel bugs as the other cause of a panic, and
we need to track down those bugs and squash them to make NetBSD
even more stable and robust than it already is.

<p>
The trouble is that the stack dump that the kernel printed is
specific to your kernel, and the numbers really have to be converted
back into symbol table references so that someone else who doesn't have
your system's kernel can get an accurate picture of where it decided to die.

<p>
At a minimum, copy down the "PC" numbers and convert them to symbolic
references - that's the <I>Program Counter</I> for the computer; where it
was executing. Ideally, if you can arrange to cut &amp; paste the
whole thing, that's even better.

<p>
So, when the kernel gives you this (usually several lines of this):

<p>
<samp>
pc = 0xf80ff430  args = (0x0, 0x41001fe5, 0xf8139c00, 0xf8123d20, 0xf8101e38, 0xf8143800, 0xf8123c68) fp = 0xf8123c68
</samp>

<p>
The PC number is specific to the kernel you were running, and is not likely
to be the same as anyone else's kernel, so it must be converted to a symbol
reference.
To convert a hexadecimal PC value to symbolic reference,
use <cite>gdb(1)</cite>, in the following way:
<p>

<pre><samp>	gdb -k /netbsd
	x 0xf80ff430

	0xf80ff430 &lt;cpu_reboot+196&gt;:     0x40000093</samp></pre>

<p>
That "&lt;cpureboot+196&gt;" result from <CITE>gdb(1)</CITE> is what the
people who will work on the problem report will need, so put it
(preferably along with the rest of that "args" line) into your
problem report.

report #3765</a> for an example of an exhaustive PR on a kernel panic.
