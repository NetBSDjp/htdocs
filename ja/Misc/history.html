<h1>The History of the NetBSD Project</h1>

<p>
NetBSD took its roots from the original UCB <b>4.3BSD</b> via the
<b>Networking/2</b> release and <b>386BSD</b>.  Since then, in addition to
the many developers within the project, it has imported changes from many
other sources, including <b>4.4BSD Lite</b>.  NetBSD has also been used as
the basis of other derivatives, including the University of Utah's
<b>Lites</b> (on top of Mach), and the <b>FreeBSD 1.x</b> line.
