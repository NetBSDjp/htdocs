<h1><A NAME="page-top">NetBSD Problem Report Fields</A></h1>

<P>
Each problem report has several machine-parseable fields in it, to make it
possible to process the reports semi-automatically. The values for
several of those fields and their definitions are listed below,
to help you more clearly specify
what's wrong (and hopefully expedite the problem resolution).
</P>

<P>
In addition to the fields listed below, NetBSD problem reports are
assigned to various <STRONG>Categories</STRONG> which reflect the part
of the overall software that is thought to be the source of the problem.
These categories are roughly split into two types:

<OL>
<LI><P>Machine Independent (e.g. <SAMP>bin</SAMP>, <SAMP>lib</SAMP>,
<SAMP>security</SAMP>) - problems in the user level programs, daemons,
libraries, and the machine independent parts of the kernel (i.e. those
parts that are the same without regard to the particular hardware that
NetBSD is running on, and therefore a problem is likely to affect <em>all</em>
platforms).</P></LI>

<LI><P>Port Specific (e.g. <SAMP>port-alpha</SAMP>, <SAMP>port-ofppc</SAMP>,
<SAMP>port-sparc</SAMP>) - device driver, or CPU-specific support (i.e. kernel
trap handlers) problems that are only going to affect the one kind of machine
that the problem occurred on.</P></LI>
</OL>
</P>

<HR>

<h2><A NAME="severity">Severity</A></h2>

<P>The severity of the problem.
The accepted values are:

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="severity-critical"><STRONG>critical</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>The product, component or concept is completely non-operational or some
essential functionality is missing (e.g. kernel panic or program core dumps).
No workaround is known.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="severity-serious"><STRONG>serious</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>The product, component or concept is not working properly or significant
functionality is missing. Problems that would otherwise be considered
<SAMP>critical</SAMP> are rated <SAMP>serious</SAMP> when a workaround is known.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="severity-non-critical"><STRONG>non-critical</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>The product, component or concept is working in general, but lacks
features, has irritating behavior, does something wrong, or doesn't
match its documentation.</DD>
</DL>

The default value is <SAMP>serious</SAMP>.</P>

<HR>

<h2><A NAME="priority">Priority</A></h2>

<P>How soon the problem report submitter requires a solution.
The accepted values are:

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="priority-high"><STRONG>high</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>A solution is needed as soon as possible.

<DT><A NAME="priority-medium"><STRONG>medium</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>The problem should be solved in the next release.

<DT><A NAME="priority-low"><STRONG>low</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>The problem should be solved in a future release.
</DL>

The default value is <SAMP>medium</SAMP>.</P>

<HR>

<h2><A NAME="class">Class</A></h2>

<P>The class of a problem report can be one of the following:

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="class-sw-bug"><STRONG>sw-bug</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>A general software problem (<SAMP>`sw'</SAMP> stands for "software").</DD>

<DT><A NAME="class-doc-bug"><STRONG>doc-bug</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>A problem with the manual pages or other documentation.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="class-change-request"><STRONG>change-request</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>A request for a change from existing behavior that is not a bug
("It's nice, but it would be better if ...").</DD>

<DT><A NAME="class-support"><STRONG>support</STRONG></A></DT>
<DD>A support problem or question.</DD>
</DL>

The default value is <SAMP>sw-bug</SAMP>.</P>
