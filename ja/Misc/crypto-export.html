<h1>Exportability of NetBSD crypto code</h1>

Previously, the (US) <em>domestic</em> portion of NetBSD (both binaries
and sources) containing code based on DES (such as KerberosIV, the
bdes command etc.) have not been legally exportable from the United
States or Canada.
<p>

Some time early in January 2000, the Bureau of Export Administration
(BXA) of the US Department of Commerce published a new set of
<a href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/ITAR_export/2000_export_policy/20000112_cryptoexport_regs.html">export regulations</a> covering the export
of cryptographic software.  The new export regulations are more
lenient in permitting export of cryptographic source code, but
require that the BXA be notified when code is made available.
<p>

The NetBSD has now sorted out the details of this issue, and the
outcome is as follows:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>The cryptographic parts of our code are still under control by
      the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
  <li>None of this software may be downloaded or otherwise exported or
      re-exported into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq,
      Libya, Sudan, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to
      which the U.S. has embargoed goods.
  <li>By downloading or using said software, you are agreeing to the
      foregoing and you are representing and warranting that you are
      not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident
      of any such country or on any such list.
</ul>

<p>
Other use or export is no longer restricted.
