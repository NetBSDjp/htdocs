<h1>NetBSD Embedded Systems</h1>

<LIST>

<p>
The  NetBSD Operating System is the most portable OS in the world. One
of the popular styles of systems it runs on are embedded. This section
contains  links  to  ports  and  platforms  that  fit  within the term
embedded as well as additional links.

<ENTRY>a1 What is an Embedded System?

<p>
The  following  definition  which can be found in the Embedded Systems
Glossary states:

     <blockquote>
     A  combination  of  computer
     hardware  and  software,  and perhaps
     additional  mechanical  or  other  parts,  designed  to  perform  a
     dedicated  function.  In some cases, embedded systems are part of a
     larger  system  or  product, as is the case of an anti-lock braking
     system in a car. [<a href="#one">1</a>]
     </blockquote>

<p>
This of course is a very subjective definition. These types of systems 
are  mainly  singular  function  systems,  a  limited  set of specific
function  systems  or  a part of an overall system. Additionally, many
systems  are designed to be embedded. A good example of this case is a
motor controller for an assembly line.

<p>
The  NetBSD  multi-platform operating system supports a wide number of
different  platforms,  many of which can and are already being used in
embedded  applications.  Among the more popular processor families for
embedded  systems  are  MIPS, PowerPC, ARM and Super-H. Visit the main
<a href="../Ports/">Platforms(ports)</a> page for more information
about different architecures supported by NetBSD.


<p>
To  see  a list of hardware products that are designed around NetBSD -
many  of  them in embedded applications - check out the
<a href="../gallery/products.html">products</a> page,
which  shows  NetBSD  being  the  #1  choice  for  multimedia servers,
copiers/printers, wireless routers and more!
