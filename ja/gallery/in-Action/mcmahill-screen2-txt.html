This screenshot of  a Sparc IPX running
<PORTPAGE>sparc with fvwm95 for a window manager shows
ongoing work on a web page.  <PKGSRC>graphics/xsane is being used as a
frontend for a scanner, feeding its output directly to
<PKGSRC>graphics/gimp for further graphic design/editing.
Netscape <PKGSRC>www/communicator is running via NetBSD's SunOS <A
HREF="../../about/interop.html">binary
compatibility</A>, the page is being served by the same machine
running the <PKGSRC>www/apache web server.
