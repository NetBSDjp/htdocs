Thanks to <a href="../../Documentation/compat.html">binary emulation in
NetBSD</a>, it is possible to run many commercial applications that are not
available for NetBSD natively, such as <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab</a>.  This screenshot shows a machine
running a -current kernel with a 1.6.1 userland, which allows you to run Sun's
latest JDK (version 1.4.2) and subsequently enables the full Matlab desktop.
