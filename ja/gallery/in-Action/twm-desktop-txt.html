Different machine, different window manager, same OS: twm on a SparcStation 
10 running <PORTPAGE>sparc 1.4.1, with some C++ source being worked on, gdb,
<PKGSRC>graphics/gnuplot for checking a different program, and an xdvi
(part of the <PKGSRC>print/teTeX package) in the background
with a paper the desktop's owner's working on.
<P>
