"This screenshot shows me running Firefox, Gaim, XFCE file
manager and Gnome-Terminal. I am browsing the NetBSD website in
Firefox while viewing my buddy list in Gaim. I'm doing this
while simultaneously compiling giblib from pkgsrc (shown in my
gnome-terminal). I installed all the applications running on my
screenshot from pkgsrc."
