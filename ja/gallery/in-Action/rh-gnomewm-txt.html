This screenshot shows some production-grade office applications
running under NetBSD.  The desktop environment is <PKGSRC>x11/gnome
along with the <PKGSRC>wm/windowmaker window manager.  In the top
left section of the screen you can see the <PKGSRC>graphics/gimp image
manipulation program.  The displayed picture has been scanned using
the <PKGSRC>graphics/xsane scanner front end displayed below.  In the
top right section of the screen lies <PKGSRC>graphics/tgif, a
technical drawing program.  Below that, there is the desktop window of
the StarOffice office suite, and on the bottom left section you can
find the <PKGSRC>math/gnumeric spread sheet displaying a table and a
print preview.
