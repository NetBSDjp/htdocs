With <a href="../../docs/software/packages.html">pkgsrc</a>, all of
your favorite applications run on NetBSD.  Here you see NetBSD 5.0
running GNOME 2.26, Firefox 3.5, OpenOffice 3, GIMP, Rhythmbox, and Pidgin.
Thanks to its Linux compatibility layer, NetBSD can make use of Adobe's
Flash plugin for Linux.
