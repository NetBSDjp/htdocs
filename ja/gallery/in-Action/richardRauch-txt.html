You can see on the cube:

<UL>
<LI> A reclining figure.  Art and aesthetics. 
<LI> Some typeset mathematics.  Math, graphics, typesetting,
     documentation. (TeX, <PKGSRC>print/teTeX, <PKGSRC>print/ghostscript, 
     <PKGSRC>graphics/gimp)
<LI> A starmap. This is from the <A HREF="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</A> project, the purple lace shows
     that part of the sky that has been examined by the project (Dec. 1999).
</UL>

The above images were independently scaled to power-of-2 dimensions (e.g.,
512x1024) in order to make <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/software/opengl/">OpenGL</A> (<PKGSRC>graphics/Mesa) happy.  Then a program (see the
<PKGSRC>editors/emacs window with source code, upper right?) read the files and had
<PKGSRC>graphics/Mesa
render the images as textures on the facets.  Program controls let me put
the eye & lights where I thought they had the best effect.  (The program
was one that I wrote this fall, and readily adapted to the purpose at
hand. )
