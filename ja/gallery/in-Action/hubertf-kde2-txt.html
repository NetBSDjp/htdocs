NetBSD configured as state-of-the-art desktop system, running KDE. 
Using Konqueror as web browser in two windows, and showing KDE's 
file browser in a third windows. KDE standard features like preview
of files in the file browser of antialiased fonts are of course
available with NetBSD too.
This display is on a notebook machine, which displays the battery
properly (the machine is connected to the power outlet).
And of course all activity is supervised by our beloved xdaemon (a xteddy
scheme ;).
