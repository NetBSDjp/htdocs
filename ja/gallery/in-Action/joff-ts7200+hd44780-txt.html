These images show NetBSD used in embedded development. The upper image 
shows a TS-7200 board equipped with in ARM9 CPU, 32MB RAM, flash drive,
10/100 Ethernet, Compact Flash, USB keyboard, WiFi-USB and serial (COM)
ports. The parallel ports are connected to a numeric keypad and a HD44780
display, on which a login can be run, as shown in the lower image. All the
code for this is in the main NetBSD distribution, no extra patches required!
