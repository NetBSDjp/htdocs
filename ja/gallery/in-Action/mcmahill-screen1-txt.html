the right is a figure being 
drawn using <PKGSRC>graphics/tgif.  At the bottom right is the output of a
simulation which   
I plotted using the GNU <PKGSRC>graphics/plotutils 'graph' program.  To the
left is part of 
a <PKGSRC>math/scilab plot window and an <PKGSRC>editors/emacs window.
The upper left is a preview of  part of my proposal.''
