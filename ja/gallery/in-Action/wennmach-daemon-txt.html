This is "blue.geo.Uni-Koeln.DE", a Dell Inspiron 3800 laptop, running
NetBSD-1.4.2. It runs KDE as desktop environment. <PKGSRC>sysutils/xosview
monitors the system activity and <PKGSRC>x11/xworld shows me where the sun
currently shines (modulo clouds).  Development work on <PKGSRC>net/arla
is going on in the two kvt windows.

The image was taken with a Kodak DC215 Zoom, and <PKGSRC>graphics/gphoto was
used to download the image to blue.
