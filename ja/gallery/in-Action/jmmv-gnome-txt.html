A busy GNOME 1.4 desktop running on top of NetBSD/i386 1.5ZC. You can
see Galeon (the web browser), The Gimp, a Gnome-MC window (file
manager) and, at last, Staroffice 5.2 running through Linux emulation.
The Favorites opened menu shows a list of other interesting programs,
like GnuCash, XCDRoast, FXTV, Emacs, etc.
