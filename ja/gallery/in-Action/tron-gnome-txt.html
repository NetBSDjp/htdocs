Do you think KDE is too big and too hungry for resources, but you
still want some integrated desktop software? Then
the <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME Project</A>'s desktop may be
interesting for you, of course ready-to-run installed from
pkgsrc's <PKGSRC>meta-pkgs/gnome package! 
The screenshot shows GNOME with the
Enlightenment window manager, the GNOME Midnight Commander and the
GNOME User Guide.
