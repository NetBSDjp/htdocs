Got a laptop or notebook machine? NetBSD supports it, no matter if
it's Intel,
Sparc or a Mac! This KDE panel
shows (from left to right) <PKGSRC>sysutils/klavg displaying the
machine's load average, <PKGSRC>sysutils/kapm showing the machine's
battery state (queried via APM), and the 
modem activity indicator that kppp (part of the <PKGSRC>net/kdenetwork3
package) brought to the panel to remain connected 
while still being mobile. And a clock. :)
