The item of interest in this picture is the horizontal grey box in the
middle of the hi-fi cabinet. It's a diskless MP3 jukebox,
running NetBSD/arm32. It's a Shark
and completely silent due to having neither disk drives (it NFS
mounts its file-systems, including '/') nor fans (as it
is based on the StrongARM processor, it generates negligable
heat). It's unlikely an Intel box could be situated in such a confined
space without noisy fans for cooling. The machine uses one of the S-video
inputs on the TV for display purposes, and an infrared keyboard/mouse
for input purposes. The Shark's audio output is of sufficiently high
quality that it takes a discerning ear to tell the difference between
the original CD and and MP3 recording on this setup.
