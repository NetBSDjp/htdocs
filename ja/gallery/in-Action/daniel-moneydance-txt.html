NetBSD is an excellent environment for running productivity applications. For 
example, this screenshot shows 
<a href="http://www.moneydance.com/">MoneyDance</a>,
a personal finance manager written in Java, running on NetBSD. It works with 
little effort using the included Linux Java runtime environment. The
sun-jre14 package contains a short note with 
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/lang/sun-jre14/MESSAGE.NetBSD">prerequisites</a>
that also apply to this runtime environment.
