<em>``Of course it runs (on) NetBSD!''</em>  Naturally, this applies to the
latest version of the K Desktop Environment, KDE 3.0, as well!  Here you see a
standard KDE3 desktop, showing the Konqueror web- and file-browser, the KDE
Control Center (which lets you customize the look and feel of your environment)
and the konsole, KDE's terminal.

<p>On top of the konsole, you can find the BSD Daemon - a 'amor' variation,
which provides helpful hints and tips as well as the proper "daemonic" feel.
