The machine running this
<a href="http://www.xfce.org">XFCE</a> desktop
has three video cards (Nvidia GeForce FX 5600 SE AGP,
Matrox MGA G400 PCI and a 3Dfx Interactive Banshee PCI) each running
at 1600x1200@75Hz with 24bit on one CRT.
The cards are automatically detected and configured by xf86cfg,
they are combined into one single 4800x1200 virtual desktop with
<tt>option "xinerama"</tt> in /etc/X11/XF86Config.
<p>

Besides many applications, 
a listing of the machine's PCI cards
showing the three graphics cards and the configuration relevant for
Xinerama from /etc/X11/XF86Config can be seen
on the right side of the desktop,
