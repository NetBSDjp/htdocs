The screenshot shows a <a href="../../ports/xen/">Xen</a> "domain0"
virtual machine, with four other virtual machines started (see
domain overview in the lower right corner): on the left side are
two domains running NetBSD, with two xterms showing the console of
the VMs, and VNC clients used to access the Xvnc servers running
in those VMs, providing a GUI to them.  A similar setup is shown
on the upper right corner, which has booted Debian Linux, both with
console in xterm and a VNC client to access the Xvnc server, too.
The last VM runs FreeBSD as console only, with no X(vnc) started.
