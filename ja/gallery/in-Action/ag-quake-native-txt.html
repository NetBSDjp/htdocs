NetBSD does QuakeWorld!  You can now enjoy late night fragfests on your 
<PORTPAGE>i386
machine with GLX based hardware acceleration (MGA or TNT) and sound!
This game binary was compiled on
<a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</a>
by porting the recently released 
<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/business/techdownloads/">Quake1 source code</a>.
You can also see a native QuakeWorld Server running in the bottom right xterm.
