Here is a screenshot of Real Player running on NetBSD/i386.
Basically, one just needs to have the suse_gtk2 and it's dependecies installed.
After that, the Real Player installation script will do the rest.
In order to play the movie, I needed to disable the XVideo X extension since
I don't have it enabled in my XF86Config.
I've also created a symlink for real player to find a suitable browser:

<P><PRE>
ln -s /usr/pkg/bin/netscape7 /usr/pkg/emul/linux/usr/bin/netscape7
</PRE>
