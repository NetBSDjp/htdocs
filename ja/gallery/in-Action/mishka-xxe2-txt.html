The latest Java Runtime Environment 1.5 is available for NetBSD-current
through binary emulation. This example shows the XML Editor
<a href="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/">XMLmind SE 2.8</a> (XXE2) running
on <a href="../../ports/i386/">NetBSD/i386 </a> 2.99.10 with the JRE 1.5
provided by the package
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/lang/sun-jre15/README.html">lang/sun-jre15</a>. 

XMLmind is a validating XML editor featuring a word processor-like view.
On the screenshot you can see a completely localized environment for XML
DocBook documentation processing. The same document is opened in the vi
editor and in XXE2.
The Mozilla browser displays the generated HTML document, containing draft
guidelines for the translation of NetBSD documentation to the Russian
language. The source document uses KOI8-R encoding and the HTML page uses
UTF-8.
