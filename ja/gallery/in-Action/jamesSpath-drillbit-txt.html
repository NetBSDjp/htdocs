In today's business world, applications from 
multiple environments need to coexist. Using NetBSD's wealth of
networking facilities and advanced remote access
capabilities, this works fine, as these images show.
<P>
The first
one shows graphs from CA/Platinum DBVision running on the DEC UNIX
machine with output displayed locally on
a <PORTPAGE>i386 machine. Below that to the left is an SAP R/3 GUI running on a
different DEC box showing a database analysis screen, to the right of
that is a 
<PKGSRC>net/vnc session running on NetBSD controlling a NT workstation.
The second screenshot adds a CA/Platinum ServerVision realtime
load average of another  UNIX machine.
