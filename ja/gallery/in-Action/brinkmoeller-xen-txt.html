This image features a Xen showcase with an
n-tier architecture that segregates the application server
and the database server by placing them in different Xen domains.
The figure shows a KDE screenshot from the Dom0 that displays
the web application JPetstore (upper left), 
a VNC screen of this DomU and the tomcat application manager (upper right), 
the PostgreSQL database with the pgSQL console domain (lower right) and
a terminal running xenconsole to monitor usage of the Xen virtual machines.
