WaveLAN Image Sniffing is possible with NetBSD and
<PKGSRC>net/driftnet.
This image shows a notebook running NetBSD 1.6.2 with a Lucent WLAN card
running driftnet to capture wireless traffic, analyze it and display any
graphical content, from HTTP and other protocols. In addition, driftnet
can also find mp3 audio streams and play them if wanted. General WaveLAN
traffic statistics are displayed in the white-on-black window on the right
side of the screen using
<PKGSRC>net/slurm.
