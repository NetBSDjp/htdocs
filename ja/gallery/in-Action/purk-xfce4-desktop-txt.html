This Athlon 1900 XP machine running NetBSD 1.6ZE is used as a personal
workstation for web development and image manipulation (GIMP), playing
music (xmms) and watching movies (DivX player).
<a href="http://www.xfce.org/">XFce 4</a>, a more lightweight desktop
environment than KDE or GNOME provide, is used here.
