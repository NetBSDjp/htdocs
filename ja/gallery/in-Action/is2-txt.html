Need to do fancy presentations? A Laptop with NetBSD/i386, or a DNARD running
NetBSD/arm32, will connect to your conferences' projection system. 
Using <PKGSRC>graphics/magicpoint will allow for colored or animated
presentations, and even call life operating system commands showing their 
text or their graphical output.
