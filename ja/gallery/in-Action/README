To add new entries, generate the following files:

 - newentry-txt.html:
	HTML-text with the "text" part that will be displayed besides the
	thumbnail image. Use HTML tags and htdocs tags like the one
	processed by list2html.pl.
 - newentry-img.html:
	HTML-text with the tags to include the thumbnail image (newentrys.gif)
	and a link to the full-sized image (newentry.gif). Other gfx formats
	than GIF may be used, but please note that JPG with it's lossy 
	compression is not appropriate for screenshots.
 - newentry.gif:
	The full-size image, see above for comments on format.
 - newentrys.gif:
	The thumbnail image, see above for comments on format.

After adding these four files, add your entry to index.list-template,
and run "make". Watch the result in "index.html". Commit.
