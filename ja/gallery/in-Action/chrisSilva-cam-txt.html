Digital cameras get increasing popular, and there are several
applications available in the NetBSD Packages Collection that 
can be used to transfer the images from the camera to the 
computer, and post-process them. Like here with an Epson PC650
digi-cam with <PKGSRC>graphics/gphoto used to access the images
stored on the camera.
