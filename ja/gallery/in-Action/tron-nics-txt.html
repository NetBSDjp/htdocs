Did you ever wonder how many network ports a notebook can have? This one
has four: one onboard, one CardBus card and two USB 2.0 network adapters.
It is running <a href="../../Ports/i386/">NetBSD-i386</a>
3.0_BETA and serves as an experimental
<a href="../../Documentation/network/ipsec/">VPN gateway</a>.
