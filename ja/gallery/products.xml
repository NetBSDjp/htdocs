Many companies have released products based on NetBSD, such as network
computers, servers, routers, embedded units, and other devices for industrial
and financial use, but prefer not to advertise the fact in order to retain
what they perceive as a commercial edge. We respect this position, and intend
to include only those vendors who wish to make their use of NetBSD public.
