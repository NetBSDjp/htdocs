Many companies have released products based on NetBSD, such as network
computers, servers, routers, embedded units, and other devices for industrial
and financial use, but prefer not to advertise the fact in order to retain
what they perceive as a commercial edge. We respect this position, and intend
to include only those vendors who wish to make their use of NetBSD public.

        <ulink url="http://www.feyrer.de/g4u/">g4u</ulink> is a
        NetBSD-based bootfloppy/CD-ROM that allows easy cloning of PC
        harddisks to deploy a common setup on a number of PCs using
        FTP. The floppy/CD offers two functions.  First is to upload
        the compressed image of a local harddisk to a FTP
        server. Other is to restore that image via FTP, uncompress it
        and write it back to disk; network configuration is fetched
        via DHCP. As the harddisk is processed as a image, any
        filesystem and operating system can be deployed using g4u.

        ready to run.

        Since then, NetBSD based Live CDs have been used in many different
        environments.  They can easily be created using the
	<pkg>sysutils/mklivecd</pkg> package.  The NetBSD 2.0 Release included
