    <p>
    Many companies have released products based on NetBSD, such as
    network computers, servers, routers, embedded units, and other
    devices for industrial and financial use, but prefer not to
    advertise the fact in order to retain what they perceive as a
    commercial edge.
    <p>
    We respect this position, and intend to include only those vendors
    who wish to be listed on this page - we prefer to restrict
    fanaticism to the quality of the code.

<LIST>
<SECTION>Software products based on NetBSD

<ENTRY>darwin Apple's Darwin
    <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/darwin/contributors.html">NetBSD
    is used by Apple</a> for a large portion of the user-space
    commands and tools in their <a
    href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/darwin/">
    Darwin</a> project, and Darwin is the UNIX-based core used by <a
    href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS X</a>. NetBSD source tends to
    pay attention to issues of portability and correctness, and is virtually
    all BSD licenced, which avoids commercial problems with the GNU General
    Public Licence. At least one of the Apple developers has access
    to the NetBSD source tree and has fed back some useful changes.

<ENTRY>rtlbsd FSMLabs' RTCore/BSD
    <a href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/">FSMLabs</a> uses NetBSD as its
    general purpose OS in their RTCore on BSD (RTCore/BSD) product.
    RTCore/BSD is a 'high speed, efficient and small realtime kernel' based
    on the POSIX 10003.13 PS51 specification.  Using a patented
    dual-kernel design, RTCore/BSD runs a general purpose OS as the lowest
    priority thread of the realtime kernel.
    <p>
    Applications written for RTCore can be easily compiled and run under
    RTCore/BSD as well as RTLinux.
    <p>
    RTCore/BSD is available from <a href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/">FSMLabs</a>
    and is provided with source code, under a binary distribution
    license.

<ENTRY>g4u Ghost for Unix (g4u)
    <a href="http://www.feyrer.de/g4u/">g4u</a> is a NetBSD-based
    bootfloppy/CD-ROM that allows easy cloning of PC harddisks to deploy a common
    setup on a number of PCs using FTP. The floppy/CD offers two functions.  First
    is to upload the compressed image of a local harddisk to a FTP server. Other
    is to restore that image via FTP, uncompress it and write it back to disk;
    network configuration is fetched via DHCP. As the harddisk is processed as a
    image, any filesystem and operating system can be deployed using g4u.  
    See the <a href="http://www.feyrer.de/g4u/">g4u homepage</a> for more 
    information.

<ENTRY>netbsd-firewall NetBSD/i386 firewall project
    The <a href="http://www.dubbele.com/">NetBSD/i386 Firewall</a>
    projects aims to provide a free firewall solution for people
    with a permanent Internet connection. This includes most users
    of cable or ADSL services, but also businesses with leased
    lines.

<ENTRY>netbsd-live NetBSD Live! CD
    The NetBSD Live! CD (originally developed by J&ouml;rg Braun) is a CD that
    boots NetBSD 1.5.2/i386 from CDROM, allows some system config (german language
    dialogs, sorry!), selection of X config, then allows starting one of several
    window managers, e.g. KDE2. Under KDE2, Koffice is ready to run.
    <p>
    The ISO image can be obtained from <a
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.5.2/i386live.iso.gz">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.5.2/i386live.iso.gz</a>
    (also available: a <a
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.5.2/i386live-cover.pdf.gz">cover</a>
    (by Hubert Feyrer)). Note that the scripts to (re)create the CD are also part
    of the image!
    <p>
    All credits and many thanks go to J&ouml;rg Braun (jb at toolbox-mag dot de),
    who developed this gem. Please see the <a
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.5.2/README.i386live">README</a> as
    well as <a href="http://www.reedmedia.net/misc/netbsd/live-cd.html">this
    website</a> for more details.

<ENTRY>oskit The OSKit
    <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/index.html">The OSKit</a> is a
    framework and a set of component libraries oriented to operating systems.
    It's goal is to lower the barrier to entry to OS R&amp;D and to lower its
    costs.  The OSKit uses NetBSD filesystem code, namely the BSD VFS layer
    supporting the local FFS filesystem, in one of its
    <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/html/oskit-wwwch34.html">
    filesystem implementation component libraries</a>.

<ENTRY>pso-tcpip PSO Systems' TCP/IP stack for VxWorks
    PSO systems ported the NetBSD TCP/IP networking stack to VxWorks,
    to produce their <a href="http://www.pso.com/psoproduct.html">PSO
    Stack</a> product. They selected NetBSD since the networking
    is more mature than that of Linux, and the licences are better
    for embedded work.

<ENTRY>qnx QNX
    The Operating System made by <a href="http://www.qnx.com/">QNX
    Software Systems Ltd.</a> uses several components of the NetBSD
    System. Details about which components can be found in the
    <a href="http://www.qnx.com/licensing/published/eula/TPOSLTG1_01.html">Licensing 
    terms</a>.
