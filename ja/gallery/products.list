    <p>
    Many companies have released products based on NetBSD, such as
    network computers, servers, routers, embedded units, and other
    devices for industrial and financial use, but prefer not to
    advertise the fact in order to retain what they perceive as a
    commercial edge.
    <p>
    We respect this position, and intend to include only those vendors
    who wish to be listed on this page - we prefer to restrict
    fanaticism to the quality of the code.

<LIST>
<SECTION>Software products based on NetBSD

<ENTRY>darwin Apple's Darwin
    NetBSD is used by Apple for a large portion of the user-space
    commands and tools in their <a
    href="http://www.publicsource.apple.com/projects/darwin/contributors.html">
    Darwin</a> project. NetBSD source tends to pay attention to
    issues of portability and correctness, and is virtually all
    BSD licenced, which avoids commercial problems with the GNU General
    Public Licence. At least one of the Apple developers has access
    to the NetBSD source tree and has fed back some useful changes.

<ENTRY>rtlbsd FSMLabs' RTL/BSD
    <a href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/">FSMLabs</a> uses NetBSD as its
    general purpose OS in their RTLinux on BSD (RTL/BSD) product.
    RTLinux is a 'high speed, efficient and small realtime kernel' based
    on the POSIX 10003.13 PS51 specification.  Using a patented
    dual-kernel design, RTLinux runs a general purpose OS as the lowest
    priority thread of the realtime kernel.
    <p>
    FSMLabs Princapal Engineer Michael Barabanov stated that "RTLinux
    applications can transparently make use of either Linux or
    BSD. We are very happy to be able to be able to give customers this
    additional choice."
    <p>
    RTL/BSD is available from <a href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/">FSMLabs</a>
    and is provided with source code, under a binary distribution
    license.

<ENTRY>pso-tcpip PSO Systems' TCP/IP stack for VxWorks
    PSO systems ported the NetBSD TCP/IP networking stack to VxWorks,
    to produce their <a href="http://www.pso.com/psoproduct.html">PSO
    Stack</a> product. They selected NetBSD since the networking
    is more mature than that of Linux, and the licences are better
    for embedded work.

<ENTRY>netbsd-firewall The NetBSD/i386 firewall project
    The <a href="http://www.dubbele.com/">NetBSD/i386 Firewall</a>
    projects aims to provide a free firewall solution for people

    lines.

<ENTRY>oskit The OSKit
    <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/index.html">The OSKit</a> is a
    framework and a set of component libraries oriented to operating systems.
    It's goal is to lower the barrier to entry to OS R&amp;D and to lower its
    costs.  The OSKit uses NetBSD filesystem code, namely the BSD VFS layer
    supporting the local FFS filesystem, in one of its
    <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/html/oskit-wwwch34.html">
    filesystem implementation component libraries</a>.
