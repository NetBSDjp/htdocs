Subject: NetBSD 1.4.3 Released
<p>

<hr>
<p>

The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.4.3.
<p>

This release fixes problems found in the earlier 1.4.x family of
releases, improves stability, and includes support for new hardware.
NetBSD 1.4.3 is a patch release of the 1.4 release branch.  The 1.5
release branch will have its major release, NetBSD 1.5, shortly.
<p>

The release binaries and source for NetBSD 1.4.3 are available now.
The pc532 and atari ports will be available in source form only for
1.4.3, but both will have release binaries for 1.5.
<p>

This release contains a number of new features which have been imported
from the main NetBSD development branch since NetBSD 1.4.2, including:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>A driver for the Lucent Wavelan (Orinoco) 802.11B wireless
      Ethernet PCMCIA card has been added, see wi(4).
  <li>The PCI Cyclom-4Y and -8Y multiport serial cards are now supported.
  <li>The Macintosh LC Ethernet Adapter is now supported.
  <li>The on-board video on Macintosh Quadra 605 is now supported.
  <li>Bugfixes to the Alteon Gigabit Ethernet driver, ti(4).
  <li>Support for several new PCI IDE controllers have been added, see
      pciide(4).
  <li>The i386 port may now be installed on wd2 or wd3. 
  <li>A possible CPU hog problem related to large I/Os has been fixed. 
      Fixes SA#2000-005
  <li>A denial-of-service problem related to handling of IP options
      has been fixed.  Fixes SA#2000-002. 
  <li>A problem with /etc/ftpchroot has been fixed.  Fixes SA#2000-006.
  <li>A minor problem related to locking of semaphore resources has
      been fixed.  Fixes SA#2000-004.
  <li>The DHCP software has been updated to ISC 2.0pl3.  This also fixes
      SA#2000-008 -- a security problem in the dhcp client code.
  <li>A problem with use of user-supplied data as a format string in
      ftpd has been fixed.  Fixes SA#2000-009. 
  <li>The sparc c++rt0.o code is now compiled with -fPIC.  This means
      that libraries with global constructors (which must link in 
      c++rt0.o on sparc/a.out) must also be compiled -fPIC.
  <li>Most countries can now import the full release without restriction,
      including the previously restricted 'domestic' portion. The only
      "problem spots" are US-embargoed countries.  Full details are
      available at <a
      href="../../about/crypto-export.html">http://www.NetBSD.org/Misc/crypto-export.html</a>
  <li>An extensive audit of the code (and corresponding fixes) has
      been done to eliminate possible buffer overruns caused by
      possible user-specified format strings.
</ul>
<p>

In addition, many bugs have been fixed -- more than 70 problems
reported through our problem tracking system have been fixed, and
NetBSD 1.4.3 also contains fixes for other non-reported problems that
were found during the 1.4.3 release cycle.
<p>
