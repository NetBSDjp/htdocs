The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce the release of NetBSD 1.4.2.
<p>

This release fixes problems found in the earlier 1.4.x family of
releases, including some security issues.  We urge users to upgrade
their systems.  NetBSD 1.4.2 includes important changes on many
architectures.
<p>

The release binaries and source are available now, and can be found on
mirror sites across the world. Please use a mirror close to you.  A
gzipped patch is available, containing all of the changes to the main
system sources since 1.4.1 (just 'src'; not including X or package
source changes).
<p>

NetBSD 1.4.2 contains a number of new features, which have been
imported from the main NetBSD development branch since NetBSD 1.4.1
was released, including:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>IPfilter upgrade to version 3.3.6
  <li>XFree upgrade to XFree86 version  3.3.6
  <li>upgdate of BIND to 8.2.2-P5
  <li>driver added for Alteon Gigabit Ethernet cards
  <li>driver added for Realtek 100Mbit/s Ethernet cards
  <li>driver added for VIA Rhine Fast PCI Ethernet cards
  <li>driver added for DPT SmartCache/SmartRAID III or IV SCSI adapters
  <li>driver added for BOCA 6-port ISA serial cards
  <li>support for X-surf board on Amiga
  <li>support for ext2fs revision 1 (with read-only support for
      'sparse_super' and 'filetype' options)
  <li>SysV compatible user management utilities (useradd, ...)
  <li>mktemp(1) added (primarily for use in shell scripts)
  <li>tcpdump now can do hex/ascii dumps
  <li>errno is now always a macro, to ease the integration of thread
      libraries with both system and third-party libraries
</ul>
<p>

Additionally, more than 120 formally reported problems have been fixed
since NetBSD 1.4.1, and NetBSD 1.4.2 also contains fixes for a lot of
non-reported problems discovered by developers and others during the
NetBSD 1.4.2 release cycle.
<p>

A full list of all the changes applied between NetBSD 1.4.1 and NetBSD
1.4.2 can be found in
