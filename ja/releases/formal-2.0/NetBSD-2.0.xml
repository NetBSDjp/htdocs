<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
  The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that the release 2.0 of the
  NetBSD operating system is now available.
</para>

<para>
  NetBSD is widely known as the most portable operating system in the 
  world. It currently supports fifty four different system architectures, 
  all from a single source tree, and is always being ported to more.
</para>

<para>
  NetBSD 2.0 continues our long tradition with major improvements in 
  file system and memory management performance, major security 
  enhancements, and support for many new platforms and peripherals.
</para>

<para>
  The addition of a native threads implementation for all platforms
  and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) on i386 and other popular
  platforms were long-standing goals for NetBSD 2.0.  Both of these
  goals have now been met&mdash;SMP support has been added for i386,
  SPARC, and PowerPC, the SMP support on Alpha and VAX has been
  improved, and the new port to the 64-bit AMD/Opteron also supports SMP.
</para>

<para>
  Please read below for more achievements in NetBSD 2.0!
</para>

<para>
  Complete source and binaries for NetBSD 2.0 are available for download 
  at many sites around the world. A list of download sites providing FTP, 
  AnonCVS, SUP, and other services is provided at the end of this 
  announcement; the latest list of available download sites may also be 
  found at: <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/mirrors/" />
</para>

<para>
  We encourage users who wish to install via a CD-ROM ISO image to
  download via BitTorrent by using the <ulink
  url="../../mirrors/torrents/">torrent files</ulink> supplied in
  the ISO image area. This is the first major release of NetBSD to add
  BitTorrent to the distribution mechanisms and its use is strongly encouraged
  to help keep bandwidth available.

  A list of hashes for the NetBSD 2.0 distribution has been signed with
  the well-connected PGP key for the NetBSD Security-Officer:

<title>About NetBSD</title>

<para> 
    The NetBSD operating system is a full-featured, open source,
    UNIX-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Networking
    Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2. NetBSD 2.0 runs
    on 54 different system architectures featuring 17 machine
    architectures across 17 distinct CPU families, and is being ported
    to more. The NetBSD 2.0 release contains complete binary releases
    for 48 different machine types.
</para>

<para>
    NetBSD is a highly integrated system. In addition to its highly
    portable, high performance kernel, NetBSD features a complete set of
    user utilities, compilers for several languages, the X Window System,
    firewall software and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full
    source code. <ulink
    url="../../docs/software/packages.html">The NetBSD Packages
    Collection</ulink> contains over 5000 packages and binary package
    releases for a number of platforms are currently in progress.

    NetBSD is free. All of the code is under non-restrictive licenses,
    and may be used without paying royalties to anyone. Free support
    services are available via our mailing lists and web site. Commercial
    support is available from a variety of sources; some are listed at:

    Internet, which enables us to communicate and share code, and
    without which the project would not exist.

      Kernel events notification framework - kqueue. &man.kqueue.2;
      provides a stateful and efficient event notification framework.
      Currently supported events include socket, file, directory,
      fifo, pipe, tty and device changes, and monitoring of processes
      and signals. kqueue is supported by all writable filesystems

      NetBSD 2.0 enforces non-executable mappings on many platforms.
      This means that the process stack and heap mappings are
      non-executable by default, making exploitation of potential
      buffer overflows harder. NetBSD 2.0 supports PROT_EXEC
      permission via &man.mmap.2; for all platforms where the
      hardware differentiates execute access from data access,
      though not necessarily with single-page granularity. When
      the hardware has a larger granularity, the rule is that if
      any page in the larger unit is executable, then the entire
      larger unit is executable, otherwise the entire larger unit
      is not executable.

      The systrace framework has been added to the system.
      &man.systrace.4; monitors and controls an application access
      to the system by enforcing access policies for system calls.
      The &man.systrace.1; utility might be used to trace an
      untrusted application's access to the system. In addition,
      it can be used to protect the system from software bugs (such
      as buffer overflows) by constraining a daemon's access to
      the system. The privilege elevation feature of systrace can
      be used to obviate the need to run large, untrusted programs
      as root when only one or two system calls require the elevated
      privilege.
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      Verified Exec support has been added in this release. Verified 
      Exec verifies a cryptographic hash before allowing execution of 
      binaries and scripts. This can be used to prevent a system from 
      running binaries or scripts which have been illegally modified 
      or installed. In addition, Verified Exec can also be used to limit 
      the use of script interpreters to authorized scripts only and 
      disallow interactive use.

      Solaris. Support for various other platforms (among them AIX, BSD/OS
      and HP-UX) is currently being worked on thanks to our new, portable
      bootstrap kit which makes it much simpler to port pkgsrc support to

    you to consider <ulink url="../../donations/">making a donation</ulink>
    to the NetBSD Foundation in support of continuing production of our
    fine operating system.  Your generous donation would be
    particularly welcome at this point in time, since the release engineering
    process for NetBSD 2.0 was unfortunately set back by hardware failures on
    the build machines, necessitating the immediate replacement of the
    equipment.
