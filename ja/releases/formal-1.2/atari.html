<h1>NetBSD/atari 1.2</h1>

<p>
NetBSD/atari 1.2 was the second formal release of
<a href="../../ports/atari/">NetBSD/atari.</a>
It runs on both the Atari-TT and Atari-Falcon.  In the
future, the MegaST-PAK/3 systems may be supported, but that largely depends
on contributions from others.

<h2>The History of NetBSD/atari</h2>

<p>
The Atari port of NetBSD became available to the public in March 1995.
The first formal release was NetBSD/atari-1.1.

<p>
Leo Weppelman was the maintainer of NetBSD/atari at the time of the 1.2
release.

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p>
A minimal system should have a 68030 CPU, 4Mb RAM (of which 2Mb ST-RAM),
an FPU and a SCSI-disk. There is currently a kernel available that contains
FPU-emulation support. Although the current emulation does not yet cover
the full mc68882 instruction set, you will see that you will get a very
workable system.

<p>
On NetBSD/atari 1.2, the following devices are supported:
<ul>
<li> ST and TT video modes, including TT-HIGH
<li> Falcon video (Only the mode active when NetBSD is started)
<li> TT-5380 SCSI adapter
<li> Most SCSI disks, CD-ROM drives, and tape drives
<li> Realtime clock
<li> SCC serial ports (serial2/modem2)
<li> 720Kb/1.44Mb floppy drive
<li> Parallel printer
</ul>

<p>
Software issues you might be interested in:
<ul>
<li> X11R6
<dl>
<dd>
There are several Xservers available for NetBSD/atari. For the Atari-TT,
only monochrome is supported on both ST-HIGH and TT-HIGH video modes. For
the Falcon there is also color support.
The Xserver binaries can be found in the '-current' distribution of
NetBSD/atari.
</dl>
<li> Bootblocks
<dl>
<dd>
NetBSD/atari allows you to install bootblocks on the NetBSD partitions allowing
you to boot or reboot into NetBSD directly without going through TOS.
</dl>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Additional information</h2>
<p>
Because there is still active development on NetBSD/atari, the list of
systems and devices supported by the '-current' distribution is per
definition larger than the list mentioned above. Examples of important
additions are:
<ul>
<li> Hades040 support
<li> Riebl+ VME support
</ul>
