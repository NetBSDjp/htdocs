<title>NetBSD-current</title>

<para>
<ulink url="../releases/release-map.html">NetBSD-current</ulink>
is a daily snapshot of the NetBSD development
source tree.  Because it is ``work in progress,'' it may not be
particularly well tested, and it may not even compile.  People
developing drivers and other system-level software for NetBSD are
encouraged to run NetBSD-current, as are people who want to be on the
bleeding edge of NetBSD development.  If you're just using NetBSD for
day-to-day work, you should probably be running a
<ulink url="formal.html">formal release of NetBSD</ulink> instead.
</para>

<para>
The version of NetBSD-current is always in the form of 
<emphasis role="bold">N.99.M</emphasis> (eg: 
<emphasis type="strong">4.99.23</emphasis>).
</para>

<para>
The <ulink url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/">Release Engineering</ulink> 
server runs nightly autobuilds for every <ulink url="../ports/">port</ulink> of -current. 
The release engineering server also has a 
<ulink url="http://releng.NetBSD.org/">web server</ulink> with autobuild statistics.
A list of <ulink url="../mirrors/#ftp-releng">mirror sites</ulink> is also available.
</para>



<para>
When incompatible changes to the kernel/userland-interface
are made, the last component in the kernel's version number
is incremented (3.99.1, 3.99.2, etc.).
Hopefully, a carefully worked out upgrade path is published on
the current-users mailing list. (This is why you <emphasis>must</emphasis>
read this mailing list, if you are running NetBSD-current).

<title>Why do something like NetBSD-current?</title>

<para>
The developers of NetBSD have made the current development sources
available to the public for several reasons.  Overall, providing
NetBSD-current helps us to create a more stable, accessible system.
</para>

<para>
We want it to be easy for
people to become involved in the development of NetBSD.  Distributing
the current development sources makes becoming involved easier,
because it allows a greater number of people to see where the system
is going.
It also makes changes from users easier to integrate; if users make
changes against the current development
sources, then virtually no integration is needed to get them into the
master source tree.
</para>

<para>
We also want people to test the software as
we're developing it.  Users of NetBSD-current are encouraged to send
in <ulink url="../support/send-pr.html">bug reports</ulink> about the current
sources, and that helps us find and fix bugs.  Because people are
testing the software soon after it's written, more bugs can be found
and eliminated.
</para>

<para>
People who use NetBSD-current may also want to find out
the <ulink url="../support/query-pr.html">state of the bug reports</ulink>.
This allows a user to track the progress of a bug report they 
submitted or even look for bugs to fix.
