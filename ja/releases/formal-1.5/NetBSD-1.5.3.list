<h2>About NetBSD</h2>
 
    The NetBSD operating system is a full-featured, open source,
    UNIX-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Networking
    Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2.  NetBSD runs on
    52 different system architectures featuring 17 distinct families
    of CPUs, and is being ported to more.  The NetBSD 1.5.3 release
    contains complete binary releases for 20 different machine
    types.
    <p>

    NetBSD is a highly integrated system.  In addition to its highly
    portable, high performance kernel, NetBSD features a complete set of
    user utilities, compilers for several languages, the X Window System,
    firewall software and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full
    source code.  We also support third party software (including the KDE
    and GNOME desktops) through our package system.
    <p>

    <p>

    NetBSD is free.  All of the code is under non-restrictive licenses,
    and may be used without paying royalties to anyone.  Free support
    services are available via our mailing lists and web site.  Commercial
    support is available from a variety of sources; some are listed at:

    NetBSD is the work of a diverse group of people spread around the
    world.  The `Net' in our name is a tribute to the Internet, which
    enables us to communicate and share code, and without which the
    project would not exist.

<h2>Major Changes Between 1.5.2 and 1.5.3</h2>

The complete list of changes between NetBSD 1.5.2 and 1.5.3 can be found
in the file <a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.3/CHANGES-1.5.3">CHANGES-1.5.3</a>
in the top directory of the source tree.  The following are highlights
only:
<p>

<ul>
<li>lpd(8) has been fixed to deal with a security issue
(<a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2001-018.txt.asc">SA2001-018</a>).</li>

<li>Drivers for Mylex DAC960, Compaq EISA array controllers, and I2O
block/SCSI devices added. This has caused ca(4) to be replaced by
ld(4). Drivers for the Mylex DAC960 management interface and
DPT/Adaptec I2O RAID management interface has also been
added. See dpti(4) and mlxctl(8).</li>

<li>A driver for the 3ware Escalade 5000 and 6000 series RAID
controllers has been added, see twe(4).</li>

<li>Various different fixes have been applied to the network device
drivers ep(4), ex(4), rtk(4), sip(4), ti(4), tl(4), and wi(4).</li>

<li>Support for some more variants of rtk(4) on CardBus has been
added.</li>

<li>The ne(4) driver has been extended to support some more pcmcia
cards.</li>

<li>Support for more pciide(4) controllers added: HPT-370A, Acard
ATP-850/860, and AMD-768. Ultra-DMA 100 support added for CMD
0649.</li>

<li>A problem with the NFS server code, exposed on NetBSD/alpha,
where use of ``..'' would return info for ``.'' has been fixed.</li>

<li>Support for ``other-endian'' file systems has been improved.</li>

<li>The layout algorithm for FFS file systems has been substantially
improved, resulting in better performance, both due to improved
locality between files and their corresponding directory, and
lessened pressure on the buffer cache.</li>

<li>The performance of soft dependencies in FFS has been
significantly improved in some circumstances.</li>

<li>Handling of init/fini section support and DWARF2 exception
handling has been added to the C runtime startup code.</li>

<li>OpenSSH has been upgraded to version 3.0.2.  Additionally, two
security problems in OpenSSH have been fixed (<a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2002-004.txt.asc">SA2002-004</a>,
<a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2002-005.txt.asc">SA2002-005</a>)
via ``point patches''.</li>

<li>A security issue arising from a race between set-uid execution
and use of ptrace has been fixed
(<a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2002-001.txt.asc">SA2002-001</a>).</li>

<li>The package tools have been extended to provide for optional
digital signatures on binary packages. Additionally, binary
package version number handling has been rewritten.</li>

<li>A driver for Creative Labs SBLive! EMU10000 has been added; see
emuxki(4).</li>

<li>A driver for ESS Allegro-1 / Maestro-3 has been added; see
esa(4).</li>

<li>Support for the 53c1010-33 and 53c1510D has been added to the
siop(4) driver.</li>

<li>IPFilter upgraded to 3.4.23.</li>

<li>The boot code on NetBSD/macppc has been improved.</li>

<li>sendmail(8) has been upgraded to version 8.11.6.</li>

<li>A long file name buffer overrun in gzip has been fixed
(<a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2002-002.txt.asc">SA2002-002</a>).</li>

<li>IPSEC policy check has been fixed for forwarded IPv4 packets
(<a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2002-003.txt.asc">SA2002-003</a>).</li>

<li>A buffer overrun in the resolver part of the C library has been
fixed
(<a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2002-006.txt.asc">SA2002-006</a>).
To fix this problem in the BIND user utilities, BIND has been
upgraded to version 8.3.3.</li>

<li>Various other kernel stability and robustness fixes have been
applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>

The <a href="../../Documentation/software/packages.html">NetBSD Packages
Collection (pkgsrc)</a>, which is used to maintain NetBSD-specific
fixes to third-party programs, has been updated for NetBSD 1.5.3.
<p>

Please note that at the moment, sysinst will not assist you in installing
pre-built third-party binary packages or the pkgsrc system itself, so you
will have to manually install packages using pkg_add(1) or fetch and
extract the <a
href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.3/source/sets/pkgsrc.tgz">pkgsrc.tgz</a>
tar file to get started.
<p>

Lastly, it should be noted that the X11 binaries shipped in NetBSD 1.5.3
are still based on XFree86 version 3.3.6.  Several newer graphics cards
are inadequately supported by that code base, but on the other hand
support for several older graphics cards is not available in newer XFree86
code.  NetBSD is in the process of moving to XFree86 version 4, and is
currently maintaining both the XFree86 3.3.6 and the XFree86 version 4
code in the xsrc source set, and you may at compile time pick which
sources to build and install.  To ease installation, testing and use of
the XFree86 version 4 code, a binary snapshot based on XFree86 version
4.2.0 has been made available for NetBSD/i386 1.5.x at:
<URL>ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/
