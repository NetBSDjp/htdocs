<title>Announcing NetBSD 3.1</title>
</head>

<para>
The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce that version 3.1 of the
NetBSD operating system is now available in both source and binary form.
NetBSD is a general-purpose Open Source operating system that provides
interfaces for running a wide range of applications on a big number of
different hardware platforms, all from one source tree.
NetBSD 3.1 contains many bugfixes, security updates,
new drivers and new features like support for Xen3 DomU.</para>

<title>About NetBSD 3.1</title>

<para>
NetBSD 3.1 is the first feature update of the NetBSD 3.0
release branch. Changes include bugfixes, critical security updates
and new minor features like new drivers. 
</para>

<para>
Complete source and binaries for NetBSD 3.1 are available for
download at many sites around the world. A list of download sites providing
FTP, AnonCVS, SUP, and other services is provided at the end of this
announcement; the latest list of available download sites may also be found
at <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/mirrors/">http://www.NetBSD.org/mirrors/</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
We encourage users who wish to install via a CD-ROM ISO image to download
via BitTorrent by using the torrent files supplied in the ISO image area.
BitTorrent has recently been added to the list of distribution mechanisms
and its use is strongly encouraged to help keep bandwidth available.

<title>About NetBSD</title>

<para>
NetBSD is a general-purpose Open Source operating system that provides
interfaces for running a wide range of applications on a big number of
different hardware platforms, all from one source tree.
Applications
can range from proprietary closed source applications to Open Source
software, covering desktop environments, database servers, firewalls,
routers, embedded appliances and many more, all made available easily
through pkgsrc, the NetBSD Packages Collection, which currently
contains over 6.300 packages.
Picking up its ancestry from the Berkeley Networking Release 2
(Net/2), 4.4BSD-lite and 4.4BSD-Lite2, the NetBSD project continues to
provide its application platform on a wide range of hardware platforms
- not only vintage hardware, but also modern desktop and server
hardware with Intel and AMD Opteron CPUs as well as embedded systems
with MIPS, PowerPC, Super-H, ARM and Xscale CPUs. More recently,
NetBSD was also ported to "virtual" hardware provided by the Xen
machine monitor. Today, NetBSD runs on 54 different system
architectures featuring 17 machine architectures across 17 distinct
CPU families, all from a single source tree. In addition, the system
offers cross compiling for the kernel, userland and the X Window
system.
</para>

<para>
The NetBSD 3.1 release contains complete binary releases for 53
different machine types, and support for four more machine
architectures in source form. 
</para>

More information on the goals of the NetBSD Project can be procured from the
NetBSD web site at <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/about/goals.html">http://www.NetBSD.org/Goals/</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
NetBSD is free. All of the code is under non-restrictive licenses, and may
be used without paying royalties to anyone. Free support services are
available via our mailing lists and web site. Commercial support is
available from a variety of sources; some are listed at <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/gallery/consultants.html">http://www.NetBSD.org/gallery/consultants.html</ulink>.

site <ulink url="http://www.NetBSD.org/">http://www.NetBSD.org/</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
NetBSD is the work of a diverse group of people spread around the world. The
`Net' in our name is a tribute to the Internet, which enables us to
communicate and share code, and without which the project would not exist.
