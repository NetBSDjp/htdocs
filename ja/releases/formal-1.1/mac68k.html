<h1>NetBSD/mac68k 1.1</h1>

NetBSD/mac68k 1.1 was the second formal release of
<a href="../../Ports/mac68k/">NetBSD/mac68k</a>.

<p>
<a href="http://www.ninthwonder.com/~briggs/">Allen Briggs</a>
was the maintainer of NetBSD/mac68k at the time of the 1.1 release.

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p>
NetBSD/mac68k 1.1 runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
A minimal system requires 4M of RAM and about 65M of disk space.
By leaving out a package or two, the system can be squeezed onto
a 40M disk.  At least 8MB of RAM and 200MB of disk space are
recommended for more serious use.  The following Macintosh
hardware is supported:
<ul>
<li> CPUs:
 <ul>
 <li> Mac II (with PMMU)
 <li> Mac IIx
 <li> Mac IIcx
 <li> Mac IIci
 <li> Mac SE/30
 <li> Mac IIsi
 <li> Mac IIvx
 <li> Mac IIvi
 <li> Performa 600
 </ul>
<li> Internal SCSI bus and most SCSI tapes, disks, and CD-ROMs
<li> Internal sound (enough to beep on some machines, anyway)
<li> Most basic NuBUS video cards (there have been some problems with
     some 24-bit color cards)
<li> Both internal serial ports
<li> ADB keyboards and mice
<li> NUBUS ethernet cards based on the National Semiconductor 8390
     (Asante, Apple, and a few others)
</ul>

If you have a device that's not listed, it might be compatible with something
else, or we might have simply forgotten it.  If all else fails, maybe you could
write a driver!

<p>
Some systems will boot and are usable from an external terminal
(serial tty or SLIP):
<ul>
<li> Mac LC III
<li> Performa 550
<li> Some PowerBooks
<li> Possibly others
</ul>

Major items often asked about, but not supported in 1.1 include:
<ul>
<li> Other ethernet interfaces.  There is no driver written yet for 
     interface cards built on the SONIC (83932) chip.
<li> 68040-based Macs.  Work is in progress on getting a couple of
     Quadras running.  This requires (at least) a new SCSI driver
     and a new ethernet driver.
<li>Machines with no FPU.  Currently an FPU is required for NetBSD/Mac68k.
    Work is proceeding to add support for machines with no FPU.  In fact,
    <a href="../current.html">NetBSD-current</a> has very functional
    support for these machines.
<li>Accelerator cards are not supported with cache enabled. Most 68030
    accelerators run NetBSD/Mac68k with cache disabled.  There may be a 
    version of NetBSD-current that will permit the cache to be enabled soon.
<li>PowerMac  - That is not the Mac 68k platform.  PowerPC is a 
    completely different architecture.  Work is proceeding on that,
    too, but it is not part of this port.
</ul>
