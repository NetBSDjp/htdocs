<h1>NetBSD Standards Conformance</h1>

<h2>Basic operating system services</h2>

POSIX (Portable Operating Systems Interface) is the name used by group
of standards sponsored by the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>
that define a standard API for UNIX-like operating systems.
POSIX.1 (IEEE Std1003.1-1990) standardizes the API for C.  POSIX.2
(IEEE Std1003.2-1992) standardizes the shell and basic utilities.  Other
POSIX standards cover Ada and Fortran bindings, real time extensions,
conformance testing, etc.
<p>

NetBSD is extremely close to being POSIX.1 compliant, and somewhat
further from being POSIX.2 compliant.  There are a few
nits we know about: some we plan to fix, and others we plan to ignore
until a future revision of POSIX ``fixes'' them for us.
<p>

People who use or distribute other free operating systems sometimes
claim that their OS is POSIX or Standard C compliant.  To our knowledge,
none of the freely redistributable operating systems have been certified
to be POSIX or Standard C compliant -- nor is this likely to change,
since certification is quite expensive and must be done for each release.
We believe that NetBSD is closer to POSIX and Standard C compliance
than any other freely redistributable operating system.
<p>

To date, no efforts have been made to conform to
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/">X/Open</a> <b>Spec 1170</b>,
as this is an extremely complex and self-conflicting specification.

<h2>X Window System and Motif</h2>

NetBSD comes with
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a>, a superset of the X Window
System Release 6.4 from the MIT X Consortium (now part of the
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/">Open Group</a>).  This implements
the basic X server and client functionality of the X Window System, and
provides some useful applications.
<p>

We also provide a number of
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/x11/README.html">ported X11 packages</a>,
including
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/x11/lesstif/README.html">Lesstif</a>,
which is a clone of the Motif toolkit.

<h2>Networking protocols</h2>

NetBSD implements many industry standard networking protocols,
including TCP/IP, SMTP, NFS, DHCP, NIS and NTP.  We also provide
ported third party packages which implement HTTP, SMB, Appletalk,
and many other protocols.
<p>

Of particular interest is our TCP/IP implementation.  We have identified
and fixed a number of performance issues with the 4.4BSD TCP
implementation, and work closely with the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> to
implement and test new protocol developments.  Our TCP/IP implementation
is used as a basis for research by some IETF members.
<p>

In addition, two IPv6 and IPsec implementations have been developed on
NetBSD, and another ported.  The KAME implementation has been
<a href="../Documentation/network/ipv6/">integrated</a>.
<p>

The industry standard routing system
<a href="http://www.gated.org/">GateD</a> also runs under NetBSD, and
several ISPs use GateD under NetBSD to do routing on their networks.
