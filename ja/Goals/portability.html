<h1>Portability and supported hardware platforms</h1>

<h2>Portability</h2>

Every effort is made to keep everything cleanly split into 'Machine
Dependent' (MD) and 'Machine Independent' (MI) areas. For example,
an Ethernet chipset would have a single MI core hardware driver,
which would be matched with appropriate MD bus attachment code for a
given platform. Not all drivers are as clean as we would like for
historical reasons, but any new driver will be, and old drivers
are in the process of being converted across.

<h2>Supported hardware platforms</h2>

NetBSD's slogan is <em>"Of course it runs NetBSD"</em>, and with good
cause.  At the time of writing NetBSD provides <a
href="../Releases/formal.html">formal releases</a> for twenty-one <a
href="../Ports/">platforms</a>, and has integrated ports for nine
others. Those numbers can be deceptive - within one port (<a
href="../Ports/mac68k/">mac68k</a>), there are 93 different
machines, of which 89 are currently supported (37 fully).
