<h1>Interoperability with other systems</h1>

<p>
Good design and correct implementation are only part of the story.  NetBSD
is also highly interoperable with other systems.
</p>

<h2>Binary emulation</h2>

<p>
NetBSD provides a binary emulation system, which permits directly running
binaries for other
<a href="../Misc/call-it-a-duck.html">UNIX-like</a> operating systems,
including FreeBSD, HP-UX, Interactive UNIX, Linux, OSF/1, SCO UNIX, SunOS,
System V Release 4, Solaris and Ultrix on the same CPU type.
For example, any NetBSD/m68k based platform can run SunOS binaries for
Sun 3 and 3x systems (but not SunOS binaries for SPARC or UltraSPARC
systems), while
<a href="../Ports/sparc/">NetBSD/sparc</a> can run SunOS and
Solaris binaries for SPARC systems.
<i>[Note: for dynamically linked binaries, the
dynamic linker and libraries from the emulated operating system
are usually required.]</i>
</p>

<p>
In addition, the
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/emulators/wine/README.html">WINE package</a>
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/emulators/doscmd/README.html">doscmd package</a>
permit running of Windows and MS-DOS applications, and the Linux version of
<a href="http://www.ardi.com/">Executor</a> can be used to run MacOS
applications.
</p>

<h2>Source compatibility</h2>

<p>
Although NetBSD releases are not currently certified, we attempt to be
compatible with established standards:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
    <strong>POSIX</strong><br>
    The Portable Operating Systems Interface from IEEE has
    quickly become the standard for minimum operating services, and is often
    specified as a requirement for computer systems.  <i>[This group of
    standards is not available on the web.]</i>
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>XPG/SUS</strong><br>
    The
    <a href="http://www.unix-systems.org/version2/">Single UNIX
    Specification</a> (an extended and now
    independently maintained subset of the X/Open Portability Guide) specifies
    a number of basic facilities not defined by POSIX.  We do not currently
    implement the STREAMS interface.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
We also follow some de facto standards:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
    <strong>BSD</strong><br>
    Due to our strong Berkeley heritage, we try to remain source compatible
    with traditional BSD systems as well.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>Linux</strong><br>
    We provide an easy-to-use emulator for programs using the Linux OSS audio
    system, making many of them substantially easier to port.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Also see:
<a href="standards.html">more information on standards conformance</a>.
</p>

<h2>Local file systems</h2>

<p>
In addition to the native 64-bit FFS file system, NetBSD can read file
systems from other operating systems, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
    <strong>FFS</strong><br>
    ffs (the Berkeley `fast file system') is compatible with the native file
    system on SunOS, Solaris, Ultrix, Digital UNIX, System V Release 4, and
    many other systems based on BSD or System V.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>EXT2FS</strong><br>
    ext2fs is the native file system currently used by Linux.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>MSDOSFS</strong><br>
    msdosfs is compatible with the traditional MS-DOS file system, used by 
    MS-DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT.  It also supports long
    file names, as implemented in Windows 95.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>CD9660</strong><br>
    cd9660 implements the ISO 9660 file system, used on most CD-ROMs.  It
    includes support for long file names and UNIX-style permissions, using
    the de facto standard `Rock Ridge' extensions.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>ADOSFS</strong><br>
    adosfs is compatible with AmigaDOS file systems.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Networking protocols</h2>

<p>
NetBSD supports a large number of network protocols.  Some of them are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
    <strong>TCP/IP</strong><br>
    NetBSD ships with a world class TCP/IP implementation (also
    used in many TCP/IP <a href="../gallery/research.html">research
    projects</a>), designed to interoperate with any other system that
    speaks TCP/IP.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>SMTP</strong><br>
    This is the standard mail transfer protocol on the Internet.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>NFS</strong><br>
    This is the usual protocol used by UNIX-like file servers.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>Appletalk</strong><br>
    Combined with native kernel support for Appletalk, the
    <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/net/netatalk/README.html">netatalk package</a> provides excellent file and print
    sharing service to Macintosh systems running MacOS.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>SMB</strong> (Microsoft networking)<br>
    Using the
    <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/net/samba/README.html">Samba package</a>,
    NetBSD can be used to provide file and print sharing services to systems
    running MS-DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT and Windows 2000.
</p></li>
</ul>
