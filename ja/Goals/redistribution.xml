<title>NetBSD's copyright and licensing terms</title>

<sect2 id="berkeley">
<title>The traditional Berkeley license</title>

<para>
For the most part, the software constituting the NetBSD operating
system is not in the public domain; its authors retain their copyright.
However, because the people working on the NetBSD Project
are committed to providing a
free operating system, the license terms that cover most of the
Project's source code
are relatively lenient.  In general, developers pattern their license
terms after what's known as the <quote>Berkeley license</quote>.  This license
was used in the University of California, Berkeley's second Berkeley
Networking Release and the 4.4BSD Lite software release, and looks like
this:

modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions
are met:

  1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright
     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
  2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the

  3. Neither the name of the University nor the names of its contributors
     may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software
     without specific prior written permission.
</html:pre></programlisting>

<para>
The license is preceded by the copyright statement itself, and
is followed by some disclaimer information, so that
if someone has problems with the software the authors can't be
held liable.
</para>

<para>
The Berkeley license is a rather liberal license.  All it requires
is that the author of the work be given due credit for their creation,
and that their name not be used to promote products based on their
work.  It allows free distribution, as long as the terms are followed,
and also allows people to modify the work and <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
distribute it, if they so choose.  Some contributors also omit the third 
clause.
</para>

<para>
Though the Berkeley license is generally used as the template for
the license
terms of works that are part of the NetBSD source tree, it does not
apply to all works in the source tree, and you should check the
individual source files to see what license applies to them.  In
particular, certain parts of the source tree are covered by the
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"><emphasis role="bold">GNU General Public License</emphasis></ulink>
(also known as the <emphasis role="bold">GPL</emphasis>),
which is very different from the Berkeley license.  Though
we would like all of the software that we distribute
to be covered by a Berkeley-style license,
we can't make other people change their license terms, and we don't
have an infinite amount of time to rewrite all of the software that
we need.

<sect1 id="why">
<title>Why the NetBSD Project uses a Berkeley-style license</title>

<para>
The people working on the NetBSD Project want to provide a
high-quality system that anyone can use for whatever they want.
We are not in it for the money (we are volunteers!), so we have no
desire to keep people from distributing our work.  However, for various
reasons, we would like credit for the work that we do, and so neither do
we want to place our work into the public domain, and thereby give
up our claim to even having our names on the software we wrote!
Berkeley-style licenses are a happy medium: they allow people to
copy and modify the software, so long as we get name recognition
and our names aren't used without our permissions.
</para>

<para>
One thing that some people don't realize about Berkeley-style
licenses is that they allow licensees (the users of the licensed work)
to sell the code, in any form, with or without modification, and that
they make no requirement that licensees give away the source code,
even if they're selling binaries.
This provides a striking contrast to the license
terms granted by the GNU General Public License, because the GPL requires
that, if you're distributing binaries, you must be willing
to give away the sources to build those binaries.
</para>

<para>
Those of us working on the NetBSD Project are aware of this
distinction, and some even value it.  As stated above, we want
<emphasis>anyone</emphasis> to be able to use the NetBSD operating system for
<emphasis>whatever</emphasis> they want, just as long as they follow the few
restrictions made by our license terms.  Additionally, we don't
think it's right to require people who add to our work and want to
distribute the results (for profit or otherwise) to give
away the source to their additions; they made the additions, and they
should be free to do with them as they wish.
</para>

<para>
In summary, the people involved in the NetBSD Project
use a Berkeley-style license where possible because it closely
matches our goal of allowing users to do whatever they'd like with
our software, while making sure that we get credit for the work we
have done.  We are pragmatic, however, and will include software
with different license terms in the NetBSD operating system if it
significantly improves the quality of the system.

<sect1 id="copyright-info">
<title>What is copyright, anyway?</title>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">This information is for educational purposes only 
and we do not claim to provide legal advice.</emphasis>  If you need legal 
advice, you should talk to a lawyer licensed to practice in your area.  If
you would like more information about copyright than we provide
here, you may want to look at the
<ulink url="http://faqs.org/faqs/law/copyright/faq/">Copyright FAQ</ulink>,
but you should note that it doesn't provide legal advice, either.
</para>

<para>
Copyright is the mechanism that allows creators to obtain certain
exclusive rights to their creations.  For instance, it allows a poem's
author the right of exclusive reproduction of his or her poem; only the
creator of a work, or those given permission by the creator, may
reproduce that work.
Copyright protects original expression.  It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
protect the ideas or facts that underlie a work, nor does it protect
any pre-existing work that the creator of a work has incorporated into
their work.
In the United States and in other countries that are
signatories to the Berne Convention, a work's creator does 
<emphasis>not</emphasis> need to mark the work in any way to retain copyright.
</para>

<para>
The various protected rights to a work can be granted by means of a
<emphasis role="bold">license</emphasis>, a set of terms and conditions that 
define the situations
in which a third party may reproduce a creator's work.  The terms
of a license can vary greatly: some licenses demand a fee, while
others make no such requirement; some licenses restrict further
redistribution of a work, while others may <emphasis>require</emphasis> it in
certain conditions.
</para>

<para>
There are many ways that the terms of a license
can come into effect.  For instance, a license agreement may be signed
before access to a work is given, or a prominent statement of the license
terms may be made along with a statement that use of the work implies
acceptance of the license terms (known as a <emphasis role="bold">shrink-wrap 
agreement</emphasis>).
</para>

<para>
Note that there is a significant difference between works for
which a creator retains copyright and works that are placed into the
public domain by their creator.  When a creator places a work into the
public domain, he or she gives up <emphasis>all</emphasis> rights to the work 
in question.  An author of a piece of software cannot say something such
as, "This work is in
the public domain.  You may redistribute it freely as long as you do
not charge for it."  This is self-contradictory, because by placing
the work in the public domain, they gave up their right to control
its reproduction.
