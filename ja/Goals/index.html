<h1>The NetBSD Project's Goals</h1>

<p>
A project has no point if it doesn't have goals.  Thankfully,
the NetBSD Project has enough goals to keep it busy for quite some
time.  Generally speaking, the NetBSD Project:

<ul>
<li><a href="system.html">provides a well designed, stable, and fast BSD
    system</a>,</li>
<li><a href="redistribution.html">avoids encumbering licenses</a>,</li>
<li><a href="portability.html">provides a portable system, which runs on
    many hardware platforms</a>,</li>
<li><a href="interop.html">interoperates well with other systems</a>,</li>
<li><a href="standards.html">conforms to open systems standards as much as
    is practical.</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In summary:
<blockquote>
The NetBSD Project provides a freely available and
redistributable system that professionals, hobbyists, and
researchers can use in whatever manner they wish.
</blockquote>

<p>
People often ask for a list of differences between NetBSD and other
freely available unix systems. It would not be appropriate to try to
explain the goals and philosophy behind other projects here - we
suggest you check each site for their goals, and make your own decision.
