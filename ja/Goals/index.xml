<para>
A project has no point if it doesn't have goals.  Thankfully,
the NetBSD Project has enough goals to keep it busy for quite some
time.  Generally speaking, the NetBSD Project:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><simpara>
    <ulink url="system.html">provides a well designed, stable, and fast BSD
    system</ulink>,
  </simpara></listitem>
  <listitem><simpara>
    <ulink url="redistribution.html">avoids encumbering licenses</ulink>,
  </simpara></listitem>
  <listitem><simpara>
    <ulink url="portability.html">provides a portable system, which runs on
    many hardware platforms</ulink>,
  </simpara></listitem>
  <listitem><simpara>
    <ulink url="interop.html">interoperates well with other systems</ulink>,
  </simpara></listitem>
  <listitem><simpara>
    <ulink url="standards.html">conforms to open systems standards as much as
    is practical.</ulink>
  </simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
In summary:
<blockquote>The NetBSD Project provides a freely available and
redistributable system that professionals, hobbyists, and
researchers can use in whatever manner they wish.</blockquote>
</para>

<para>
People often ask for a list of differences between NetBSD and other
freely available unix systems. It would not be appropriate to try to
explain the goals and philosophy behind other projects here - we
suggest you check each site for their goals, and make your own decision.
