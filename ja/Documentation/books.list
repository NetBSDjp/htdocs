<ENTRY>2-212-11463-X  Cahiers de l'Admin BSD <em>(French)</em>
Author: Emmanuel Dreyfus<br>
Publication: Eyrolles, 2004 (ISBN 2-212-11463-X)
<p>
The book is about UNIX system administration with BSD. It is aimed at
readers that know about computers, but not nescessarily about UNIX. It
covers UNIX basics, BSD installation, various system administration
tasks, TCP/IP networking, firewalls setups, package systems, "classic"
services such as web, DNS and Internet mail, and disaster management.
<p>
The primary focus of the book is of course BSD, but whenever it is possible,
the author tried to give the reader a broader view of how things works on
other UNIX systems (e.g. : System V and Linux, sometimes MacOS X).  The idea
is to give the reader a strong BSD knowledge, but also a good UNIX culture.

<ENTRY>0-201-79940-5 Code Reading - The Open Source Perspective
Author: Diomidis Spinellis<br>
Publication: Addison-Wesley, 2003 (ISBN 0-201-79940-5)
<p>
"Fact: If you make a habit of reading good code, you will write better code
yourself."<br><br>

In this book, the author covers one of the most important tasks faced by
programmers every day:  reading and understanding existing code.  He
thoroughly explains basic programming elements, project design as well as
coding standards and conventions, concluding with a real life example of how
to extend a given program by reading code from various sources and improving
on it.<br><br>

The vast majority of the code examples in the book are based on NetBSD source
code (a snapshot of NetBSD 1.5_ALPHA is part of the software of the
accompanying CD-ROM), because the NetBSD Project's emphasis on "correct design
and well-written code" makes it "a superb choice for providing example source
code."<br><br>

<ENTRY>0-201-63338-8 UNIX Systems for Modern Architectures
Author: Curt Schimmel<br>
Publication: Addison Wesley, 1994 (ISBN 0-201-63338-8)
<p>
From the inside flap: "The goal of this book is to provide practical
information on the issues operating systems must address in order to run
on modern computer systems that employ cache memories and/or multiprocessors.
At the time of this writing, a number of books describe UNIX system
implementations, but none describes in detail how caches and multiprocessors
should be managed. Many computer architecture books describe caches and
multiprocessors from the hardware aspect, but none successfully deals with
the operating system issues that these modern architectures present. This
book is intended to fill these gaps by bridging computer architecture and
operating systems."  Highly recommended for its organization and
thoroughness. <a
