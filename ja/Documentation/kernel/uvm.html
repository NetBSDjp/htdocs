<h2>What is UVM</h2>
<strong>UVM</strong> is a complete rewrite of the NetBSD virtual memory
system, and has proven to be a much better performer than the Mach VM
system. <strong>UVM</strong> also supports advanced features such as
page loanout, and is being used in the development of a unified buffer
and page cache for NetBSD. For a detailed description, see the 
<a href="http://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/pub/chuck/tech/uvm/">UVM web page.</a>

<hr>
<h2>Who wrote UVM</h2>
Chuck Cranor designed and implemented <strong>UVM</strong>, Matthew
Green handled integration issues and wrote the swap subsystem, Chuck
Silvers wrote the anonymous memory object pager (which added support for
shared memory), and various other developers have converted the
appropriate ports across.

<hr>
<h2>Which ports use UVM</h2>
<strong>UVM</strong> is not available in the 1.3.X distributions, but
will be enabled on all ports for 1.4, and is also available in any
-current <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/">snapshots</a>

<hr>
<h2>What does the U stand for in UVM?</h2>
<strong>UVM</strong> used to be part of another project worked on by
Chuck Cranor that started with the letter "U" (for "universal")...
however, that project mutated into just <strong>UVM</strong>...  so the
"U" doesn't really stand for anything anymore: "<strong>UVM</strong>"
is just a name that is different from (but close to) "vm".
