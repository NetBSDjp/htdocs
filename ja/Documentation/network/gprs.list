<HEADING>NetBSD Networking with GPRS, CDPD

<LIST>

<ENTRY>intro Introduction

In GPRS/CDPD, the cards
are modems in the true technical sense, but not in the popular sense.
ie: they don't dial a PSTN phone number, receive a carrier, negotiate
a speed, and pass serial data back and forth.
<p>

The cards talk to a cellular base station using cellular packets. Inside
those packets are IP datagrams and the base stations route those data-
grams onto the internet.  The client does not speak 'ppp' to the base
station.  The client speaks ppp only to the card. The card de-ppp's
the packets, re-wraps them into either CDPD or GPRS packets, and 
transmits them out the antenna to the base-station.   The cards present
a PPP interface to the client so as to make it easier to configure drivers
for client operating systems.  As you see, there are no modifications
required to NetBSD utilities, just configurations.
<p>

In the case of GPRS, the modem has (I think) 5 provider configurations.
You configure one of those configurations for each service provider you
are signed up with.  There are some parameters you specify using 
"AT" commands.  
<p>

CDPD also is setup using AT commands but there is only one configuration
for each provider.
<p>

'kermit' can be used to send the initial AT configuration commands to the modem
(once, after receiving the modem from the manufacturer). Once the modem
is configured, you never need to use 'kermit' again.  Supposedly a person 
could use 'tip' since it's part of the distribution but it's more difficult
to explain how to set it up and how to use it in a document.
The configuration of the modems themselves is beyond the scope of
this document, please check your vendor's documentation. 
With GPRS etc. evolving, it's possible the provider will pre-configure the
cards for their customers or provide them with a cheat-sheet.  In all
likelihood, just like a cellphone, when you buy it from a provider, they will
do the setup for you.
<p>

In any case, the command which initiates PPP is model specific.  
<p>


<ENTRY>gprs Using a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) card

To use the NovatelWireless GPRS wireless data card, you must first 
configure the card according to the manufacturer and provider 
settings.  Please contact your provider.
Tested GPRS cards include NovatelWireless Merlin G100 and 
NovatelWireless Merlin G201.
<p>

Once you have done this, a few files need to be edited. These are:
<p>

<dl>
<dt> <tt>/etc/ppp/options.gprs</tt>:
<dd>
<pre>
/dev/tty03
115200
defaultroute
ipcp-accept-local
ipcp-accept-remote
noauth
novj
connect 'chat -v -f chatscript.gprs'
user dummy
usepeerdns
mru 1500
mtu 1500
</pre>
</dd></dt>

<dt> <tt>/etc/ppp/chatscript.gprs</tt>:
<dd>
<pre>
ABORT BUSY ABORT 'NO CARRIER' ABORT ERROR '' AT OK 'ATDT*99#' CONNECT
</pre>
</dd></dt>

<dt> <tt>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt>:
<dd>
<pre>
* * "dummy"
</pre>
</dd></dt>


After that, start with the following commandline:
<p>

<pre>
pppd file /etc/ppp/options.gprs
</pre>

This will cause the card to attach to the default provider as configured
into your card.  To connect to a different provider configured into a
different config slot in the card, you will have to modify the "ATDT"
string in /etc/ppp/chatscript.gprs according to the documentation
provided by NovatelWireless. 
<p>

Modify the tty in /etc/ppp/options.gprs as appropriate.  For a typical
laptop with a builtin modem, com port and IR port, the NovatelWireless
modem will appear as tty03.
<p>

Also, make sure to modify /etc/ppp/chap-secrets with your username and
password as supplied to you by your provider.
<p>

See the <a href="./">networking documentation</a> for more information on 
using PPP networking with NetBSD.

<ENTRY>sony-ericcson-t200 Using a SonyEricsson t200

<small>The following information was provided by Andrew Cagney:</small>
<p>
The SonyEricsson t200 GPRS phone has it's serial baud rate wired to 9600.
It doesn't drop the GPRS connection when pppd disconnects, and finally the USB
phone cable provided doesn't appear to work under Netbsd at this point in
time.
</p>
<p>The last problem can be worked around by using a USB<->serial cable and
connecting that to the SonyEricsson.  The first two problems can be worked
around/solved by including an init, connect and disconnect script in the
options or peers file:
</p>
<pre>
115200
init "/etc/ppp/chat/t200.sh"
connect "chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat/t200"
disconnect "chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat/hup"
</pre>
</p>
Then, t200.sh should contain:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# Find out the intended baud rate
b=`stty -g | sed -e 's/.*ispeed=//' -e 's/:.*//'`
# Force the serial line to 9600 baud so that it can be re-configured
stty 9600
# Ask for the modem to list all baud rates, and the current one.  Then
# force it to the rate the line was originally set to.
if chat -v \
    TIMEOUT 5 '' \
    +++AT OK \
    AT+IPR=? OK \
    AT+IPR? OK \
    AT+IPR=${b} OK
then
    stty ${b}
    exit 0
else
    exit 1
fi
</pre>
The file t200 should contain:
<pre>
ABORT BUSY
ABORT ERROR
ABORT 'NO CARRIER'
ABORT 'NO DIALTONE'
ABORT 'NO DIAL TONE'
TIMEOUT 10 ''
AT OK--AT--OK
# Ask the modem its baud rate - a sanity check
AT+IPR=? OK
AT+IPR? OK
# connect
ATDT*99# CONNECT
</pre>
And, finally, the hup file should read:
<pre>
TIMEOUT 2
'' +++ATH OK
</pre>

<ENTRY> cdpd Using a Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) card

Using the NovatelWireless CDPD wireless data card, you must first 
configure the card according to the manufacturer and provider 
settings.  Please contact your provider.
The only card tested so far is the NovatelWireless Merlin CDPD.
<p>

Again, a few files need configuration. These are:

<dl>
<dt> <tt>/etc/ppp/options.cdpd</tt>:
<dd>
<pre>
/dev/tty03
115200
defaultroute
ipcp-accept-local
ipcp-accept-remote
noipdefault
novj
noauth
connect 'chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chatscript.cdpd'
mru 1500
mtu 1500
</pre>
</dd></dt>

<dt> <tt>/etc/ppp/chatscript.cdpd</tt>:
<dd>
<pre>
ABORT BUSY ABORT 'NO CARRIER' ABORT ERROR '' AT OK 'AT\\APPP' CONNECT
</pre>
</dd></dt>


Once this is done, call the following commandline:
<p>

<pre>
pppd file /etc/ppp/options.cdpd
</pre>

Modify the tty in /etc/ppp/options.cdpd as appropriate.  For a typical
laptop with a builtin modem, com port and IR port, the NovatelWireless
modem will appear as tty03.
