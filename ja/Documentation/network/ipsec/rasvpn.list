<SECTION>Remote user access VPN

<ENTRY>context Context
Many organisations have a Remote Access Server (RAS) providing users a 
remote access to the internal network through modem connections over the
Plain Old Telephone System (POTS). 
<p>

With the raise of high bandwidth connections like Digital Subscriber Line
(DSL) and cable, using POTS for the remote access is getting obsolete, 
and users want a high bandwidth remote access. Using Virtual
Private Networks (VPN) is a solution to this problem.
<p>

User authentication for VPN access can be done by different methods:
<ul>
<li>Group password (every users have the same password)
<li>Login and password
<li>x509 certificate
</ul>
<p>

Group password is a weak solution and should not be used, because users
are not really authenticated. x509 certificate gives you the highest 
security, but user certificates might be troublesome to manage. If you
can afford it, then everything you need to know is in the 
<a href="index.html">IPsec FAQ</a>. Login and password are an average
security level. Because passwords can be guessed or disclosed by another 
protocol (e.g.: POP3 without SSL), it is not highly secure, but it can 
be made reasonably secure if strong passwords are enforced and if the
protocol used ensures they cannot be sniffed.
<p>

This HOW-TO covers the situation where login and password
are to be used for remote user VPN access.
<p>

<ENTRY>security Security considerations
In order to establish a secured VPN, the remote user must authenticate to 
the VPN gateway, and the VPN gateway must authenticate to the remote user. 
If the mutual authentication is not performed, then there is a loophole
open for Man in the Middle (MiM) attacks, where an attacker can masquerade
as athe VPN gateway and collect user passwords.
<p>

We said the remote user will authenticate using login and password. How
can the VPN gateway authenticate? If a pre-shared key is used, then anyone
knowing the key will be able to masquerade as the VPN gateway, and all the
legitimate users will have to know about the pre-shared key. This is really
weak security. The alternative is to use a x509 certificate on the VPN 
gateway. This is a server certificate, which is much easier to manage than 
user certificates. We will assume a certificate is used to authenticate the
VPN gateway.
<p>

<ENTRY>solutions Solutions
We want user authentication using a login and a password, and VPN gateway
authentication using a certificate. There are not many solutions available.
<a href="http://www.openvpn.org">OpenVPN</a> is a Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
based solution that is able to do what we want. An alternative is to use 
IPsec, which is what we will cover here.

<SECTION>User remote access using IPsec

<ENTRY>ph1auth IPsec phase 1 authentications
IPsec phase 1 is part of the IPsec Key Exchange (IKE) operations performed
by the IKE daemon, also known as racoon(8) in NetBSD. Its goal is to 
authenticate the peers and set up master keys for performing a secured 
IPsec phase 2. The goal of phase 2 is to derive the keys used for exchanging
IPsec traffic. Phase 2 rekeying can occur regularly while IPsec traffic
is exchanged.
<p>

IPsec phase 1 offers two authentication methods: pre-shared keys and 
certificates. This is not what we want because
<ul>
<li>pre-shared keys are not bound to logins. We have no management tools
to handle them properly, leaving a group password as the only managable
option.
<li>IPsec phase 1 authentication is supposed to be symetric: pre-shared keys 
on both endpoints or certificates on both endpoints. This is not what we 
are looking for.
</ul>

<ENTRY>xauth Xauth
Xauth is an IKE extension that occurs after phase 1 and adds a 
login/password authentication. This solves half of the authentication 
problem: because Xauth occurs just after phase 1, it is secured by 
phase 1 authentication. You still need a pre-shared key or a certificate
in phase 1. Using a pre-shared key is not secure, and using a certificate
means you use user certificates, which is something we wanted to avoid.

<ENTRY>hybrid Hybrid auth
Hybrid auth is another IKE extension, that makes phase 1 asymetric. During
phase 1, the VPN gateway can use a certificate, while the remote user does 
not have to authenticate. After phase 1 we are in a situation where:
<ul>
<li>Remote user knows it speaks to the VPN gateway
<li>Communications between the remote user and the VPN gateway are secure
<li>The VPN gateway has no idea about who it is talking with
</ul>
<p>

After this phase 1, an Xauth exchange can occur to securely authenticate
the remote user. Then phase 2 can take place.
<p>

The security level of IPsec + Xauth + Hybrid auth is roughtly equivalent
to SSH using password authentication. 

<ENTRY>mode_cfg ISAKMP mode config
So our authentication problem is solved by using IPsec + Xauth + Hybrid auth.
In order to make the thing really user friendly, we need to make the remote
user machine configuration automatic. ISAKMP mode config is an IKE extension
that enable the VPN gateway to provide the network configuration for the 
remote user's machine: Internal IP address, DNS address, domain name, 
and so on. 
<p>

<ENTRY>nat_t NAT Traversal
The remote user might be hidden behind a Network Address Translator (NAT),
which will not work when using IPsec encrypted streams. When traffic has
to be encrypted, IPsec uses a layer 4 protocol known as 
Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP). Unlike TCP or UDP, ESP has no port
number and cannot easily be handled by NAT devices.
<p>

RFC 3947 and 3948 describe a method to encapsulate ESP in UDP, and IKE
extensions to manage NAT in between endpoints of IPsec streams. The
encapsulation method ans IKE extensions are together known as
NAT Traversal (NAT-T). 
<p>

NAT-T <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/ipr_detail_show.cgi?&ipr_id=78">might be encumbered</a> by a US patent.

<ENTRY>ike_frag IKE fragmentation and ESP fragmentation
Remote users will often connect from behind DSL modem-router appliances.
Most of these devices are uterly broken when dealing with big UDP packets:
they assume UDP can only be used for DNS requests and will drop bigger
or fragmented UDP packets. IKE transactions and ESP over UDP will tend 
to use big UDP packets, and will therefore be blocked.
<p>

In order to address that problem, we use IKE fragmentation, which is an 
IKE extension used to fragment the IKE packets into smaller fragments. 
ESP fragmentation addresses the problem of big ESP over UDP packets, by
performing IP fragmentation before the ESP encapsulation: instead of 
sending frag(IP/UDP/ESP/IP) on the network, we send IP/UDP/ESP/frag(IP).
Devices between the IPsec endpoints therefore do not see any fragmented
packets.

<ENTRY>dpd Dead Peer Detection
Last problem: the remote user Internet connection can be unstable, leading
to spurious deconnections. The only built-in mechanism IPsec has to handle 
that is to force IKE phase 2 rekeying after some time. If the peer is not
on-line anymore, it will fail, thus causing the VPN tunnel to be destroyed.
<p>

This is not very convenient as it forces frequent rekeying to detect 
that the remote user got off-line. Dead Peer Detection (DPD) is an IKE
extension used to regularly probe the remote IPsec endpoint for activity.
DPD can be used to detect that the remote host went off-line within a
few seconds.

<SECTION>A VPN gateway setup
Here is a setup example for a VPN gateway using IPsec + Xauth + Hybrid auth +
ISAKMP mode config + NAT-T + DPD + IKE fragmentation + ESP fragmentation.

<ENTRY>kernel Kernel configuration
First you need to <a href="../../kernel/#how_to_build_a_kernel">build and 
install a kernel</a> with at least the following options:
<pre> 
options INET
options GATEWAY
options PFIL_HOOKS
options IPSEC
options IPSEC_ESP
options IPSEC_NAT_T

pseudo-device   ipfilter
</pre>

<ENTRY>forw Packet forwarding
You need to enable IPv4 packet forwarding, by using the following command:
<pre>
# sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
</pre>
This can be automatically executed on reboot by adding this line 
to <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>: 
<pre>
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
</pre>

<ENTRY>cert Certificate generation
If you have not already configured OpenSSL, start by installing the sample
config file:
<pre>
# cp /usr/share/examples/openssl/openssl.cnf /etc/openssl/
</pre>

Then create a private key and use it to create a Certificate Signing 
Request (CSR):
<pre>
# cd /etc/openssl
# umask 077
# openssl genrsa > certs/vpngw.key
# umask 022
# openssl req -new -key certs/vpngw.key -out certs/vpngw.csr
</pre>

Send the CSR, <tt>vpngw.csr</tt> to a Certificate Authority (CA) for
signature. You will get a x509 certificate, that we shall name 
<tt>vpngw.crt</tt>
<p>

If you want to be your own CA, then perform the following steps to 
generate the CA private key and certificate, and to sign your CSR:
<pre>
# cd /etc/openssl
# mkdir -p demoCA/newcerts
# touch demoCA/index.txt
# echo "00" > demoCA/serial
# umask 077
# openssl genrsa > certs/ca.key
# umask 022
# openssl req -days 3650 -x509 -key certs/ca.key -new > certs/ca.crt
# openssl ca -in certs/vpngw.csr -keyfile certs/ca.key -cert certs/ca.crt -out certs/vpngw.crt
</pre>
<p>

Keep the secret keys secret, as your VPN will not be secure anymore if they
get disclosed. Give the CA certificate <tt>ca.crt</tt> to remote users, and
move to the next step.

<ENTRY>config Configuring racoon(8)
Here is a sample <tt>/etc/racoon.conf</tt> file:
<pre>
path certificate "/etc/openssl/certs";

listen {
        adminsock disabled;
}

remote anonymous {
        exchange_mode aggressive;
        certificate_type x509 "vpngw.crt" "vpngw.key";
        my_identifier asn1dn;
        proposal_check claim;
        generate_policy on;		# automatically generate IPsec policies
	dpd_delay 20;			# DPD poll every 20 seconds
        nat_traversal force;		# always use NAT-T
        ike_frag on;			# use IKE fragmentation
        esp_frag 552;			# use ESP fragmentation at 552 bytes
        proposal {
                encryption_algorithm aes;
                hash_algorithm sha1;
                authentication_method hybrid_rsa_server;
                dh_group 2;
        }
}
mode_cfg {
        network4 10.99.99.1;		# 1st address of VPN IPv4 pool
        pool_size 253;			# size of the VPN IP pool: 253 addresses
        auth_source system;		# validate logins against /etc/passwd
        dns4 10.0.12.1;			# IPv4 DNS server
        wins4 10.0.12.1;		# IPv4 WINS server
        banner "/etc/racoon/motd";	# Banner message for clients
	pfs_group 2;
}

sainfo anonymous {
	pfs_group 2;
        lifetime time 1 hour;
        encryption_algorithm aes;
        authentication_algorithm hmac_sha1;
        compression_algorithm deflate;
}
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>mode_cfg</tt> section defines the configuration sent from the
VPN gateway to the client using ISAKMP mode config. 
For now only IPv4 configuration is supported. 
The VPN address pool is defined there, by a base address (<tt>network4</tt>)
and a pool size (<tt>pool_size</tt>). <tt>auth_source</tt> explains how
the login and passwrod are validated. Possible values are <tt>system</tt>, 
to validate against the system user database, <tt>pam</tt> to use the 
Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) system (<tt>/etc/pam.d/racoon</tt> 
will be used), and <tt>radius</tt> to 
validate logins against RADIUS. 
<p>

Once your <tt>/etc/racoon.conf</tt> file is ready, you can launch 
racoon(8):
<pre>
# racoon
</pre>
<p>
In order to have racoon(8) started up at boot time, you need the following
in <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>:
<pre>
racoon=YES
</pre>

<ENTRY>more_frag More fragmentation problems
In the configuration sample, <tt>esp_frag</tt> is specified so that ESP
fragmentation is used to avoid sending packets bigger than 552 bytes. 
552 bytes is quite low, but it should work with the most broken DSL 
modem-routers appliances. The higher <tt>esp_frag</tt> is, the better
the performances are.
<p>
Using ESP fragmentation, it is possible to exchange IP packets of any
size through the tunnel. However, there is a special case for TCP, which
may have trouble with Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) discovery. 
The solution is to use Maximum Segment Size (MSS) clamping. This can be 
done in <tt>/etc/ipnat.conf</tt>, assuming your VPN internal address
pool is 10.99.99.0/24:
<pre>
map ex0 10.99.99.0/24 -> 0/0 mssclamp 552
</pre>
And type the following to enable that configuration:
<pre>
# ipf -E; ipnat -f /etc/ipnat.conf
</pre>
In order to have those commands executed on startup, you need
the following in <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>:
<pre>
ipfilter=YES
ipnat=YES
</pre>
Note that the system will not boot with <tt>ipfilter=YES</tt> if the
<tt>/etc/ipf.conf</tt> file is missing. You can create a blank file
if you do not need any IP filtering.

<ENTRY>firewall Interraction with firewalls
In this VPN solution, the client needs to send UDP packets to ports 500 
and 4500 of the VPN gateway. The first packets are exchanged on port 500, 
then NAT-T negociation moves the transaction to port 4500.
<p>
Firewalls in front of the VPN gateway must be configured 
to let udp/500 and udp/4500 pass through to the VPN gateway.


<ENTRY>radius VPN gateway and RADIUS 
RADIUS can be used for login validation, IP addresses allocation and 
accounting. Here is a sample <tt>mode_cfg</tt> section for
<tt>/etc/racoon.conf</tt> that enforces RADIUS usage:
<pre>
mode_cfg {
	pool_size 253;			# IPv4 pool size
	auth_source radius;		# login validated against RADIUS
	conf_source radius;		# IPv4 address obtained by RADIUS
	accounting radius;		# RADIUS accounting
        dns4 10.0.12.1;			# IPv4 DNS server
        wins4 10.0.12.1;		# IPv4 WINS server
        banner "/etc/racoon/motd";	# Banner message for clients
	pfs_group 2;
}
</pre>
<p>

Additionnaly, you need to create a <tt>/etc/radius.conf</tt> file that
contains the RADIUS server address and the secret shared with the RADIUS
server. This file must be owned by root and mode 0600 in order to keep 
the shared secret secure. Here is an example, see radius.conf(5) for
the details:
<pre>
auth radius.example.net MyDirtySecret
acct radius.example.net MyDirtySecret
</pre>
<p>

<SECTION>VPN client
<ENTRY>client Cisco VPN client
The VPN gateway setup presented in the previous section is interoperable 
with the Cisco VPN client configured in mutual group authentication (this is
a synonym for Hybrid authentication). The group and group password required 
by Cisco VPN client are ignored by racoon(8), but that does not make user
authentication unsecure.
<p>

Do not forget to set up the client with IPsec over UDP transport to get 
NAT-T enabled.
<p>

<ENTRY>client_conf racoon(8) as the client: configuration example 
It is also possible to use racoon(8) as a client. You need to install the
CA certificate in <tt>/etc/openssl/certs/ca.crt</tt>, and the configuration
below in <tt>/etc/racoon.conf</tt>
<pre>
path certificate "/etc/openssl/certs";
path pre_shared_key "/etc/racoon/psk.txt";

listen {
	# socket used for communication between racoon and racoonctl
        adminsock "/var/racoon/racoon.sock" "root" "operator" 0660;
}

# Here is the address of the VPN gateway
remote 192.0.2.50 {
        exchange_mode aggressive;
        ca_type x509 "ca.crt";
        proposal_check obey;
        mode_cfg on;		# accept config through ISAKMP mode config
	dpd_delay 20;
        nat_traversal force;
        ike_frag on;
        esp_frag 552;
        script "/etc/racoon/phase1-up.sh" phase1_up;
        script "/etc/racoon/phase1-down.sh" phase1_down;
        passive off;
        proposal {
                encryption_algorithm aes;
                hash_algorithm sha1;
                authentication_method hybrid_rsa_client;
                dh_group 2;
       }
}


sainfo anonymous {
        lifetime time 1 hour;
        encryption_algorithm aes;
        authentication_algorithm hmac_sha1;
        compression_algorithm deflate ;
}
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>phase1-up.sh</tt> and <tt>phase1-down.sh</tt> scripts are called
when the IKE phase 1 is established and terminated, that is, at VPN 
connection and disconnect time. They are responsible for setting up
and deleting the IPsec Security Policies (SP), VPN IP address, and 
routing entries. The sample scripts should do what you need, but you can
customize them to fit your particular needs.
<pre>
# cp /usr/share/examples/ipsec-tools/roadwarrior/client/*.sh /etc/racoon/
</pre>
<p>

Once this is ready, you can start racoon(8):
<pre>
# racoon
</pre>
In order to have it started at boot time, add <tt>racoon=YES</tt> to 
<tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>.

<ENTRY>connection Connecting to and disconnecting from the VPN
racoonctl(8) can be used to connect to the VPN and to disconnect from it. The
login is given through the <tt>-u</tt> option and the password is 
prompted on the terminal:
<pre>
$ racoonctl vc -u username 192.0.2.50
Pasword: password
Bound to address 10.99.99.3
==========================================================
                     Flying pigs LTD

 Welcome to our internal network, remote user.
==========================================================
$ racoonctl vd 192.0.2.50
VPN connection terminated
</pre>
DNS addresses can be used instead of IP addresses in this example.
Note that if for some reason the routing entries or Security Policy
Database (SPD) get screwed, the DNS resolution will not work at VPN 
disconnect time. To recover from such a situation, type the following 
commands as root:
<pre>
# setkey -F
# setkey -FP
# route flush
# route add default your_default_gateway
</pre>
<p>

Anyone with read/write rights to the racoon(8) socket 
<tt>/var/racoon/racoon.sock</tt> can start or stop the VPN. The
ownership and rights to the socket can be set using the <tt>adminsock</tt>
statement in the <tt>listen</tt> section of <tt>/etc/racoon.conf</tt>.

<ENTRY>save_pwd Saving Xauth password
If you want to avoid typing the Xauth password, you can store it in
racoon's Pre-Shared Key (PSK) file. Add the following statement in 
the <tt>remote</tt> section of <tt>/etc/racoon.conf</tt>:
<pre>
	xauth_login "username";
</pre>
<p>

Then add a line in <tt>/etc/racoon/psk.txt</tt> with the login and the
password:
<pre>
username	password
</pre>
<p>

With that setup, this command will establish the VPN connection using the
<tt>toto</tt> login, without prompting for a password:
<pre>
$ racoonctl vc 192.0.2.50
</pre>
