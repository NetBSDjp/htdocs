#
# meanings:
#
# "server" - the smb name of the machine connected to the printer. This will
#            be given to nmblookup to find the IP address of the machine, so
#            the machine can be configured for DHCP. Note that it must be on
#            the same subnet, as nmblookup only uses broadcast WINS packets
#            unless otherwise instructed
#
# "service" - name of the printer service on the remote machine.
#

# "password" - usually this can be blank. On some systems you might
#            need a password
#

# "device" - which GhostScript device driver to use. This assumes
#            input is PostScript. If you don't give a device=, or if
#            you give the device as "ps", no translation will be done
#            (useful if the printer really is a PostScript device, or
#            if you want to send straight ASCII text to the printer)
#
# "gs_options" - Any extra options you need to give to GhostScript. In
#            my case, I have to force it to 300x300 resolution, since the
#            ljet4 device driver defaults to 600x600, but my Laserjet 4L
#            only supports 300x300.
