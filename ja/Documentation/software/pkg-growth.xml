    <para>The NetBSD Packages Collection celebrated its fifth birthday
    in October 2002, and it now contains over 3000 packages!
    We are all grateful to everyone who has helped make this
    possible.</para>

      <para>Note: In the <ulink
      url="../../images/graphs/growth-all.png">first version</ulink> of
      this graphs, the OpenBSD graph was only estimated, as the RCS
      files of the OpenBSD repository were not publicly available and
      inquiries to the OpenBSD project were not answered at the time the
      graphs were generated.  In this version, the data for OpenBSD as
      well as NetBSD and FreeBSD were pulled out of the RCS files, as
      their repositories are fully available now (many thanks to those
      providing that service).</para>
