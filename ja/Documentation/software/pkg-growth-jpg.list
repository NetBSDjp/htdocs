<HEADING>NetBSD Package system growth

<LIST>

    The NetBSD Packages Collection celebrated its second birthday
    in October 1999, and it also passed the 1000 package mark during
    that month. At the beginning of the new millennium (2001 :-) we
    were rapidly approaching 2000 pkgs.
    We are all grateful to everyone who has helped make this possible.

    <p> Note: In the <a
    href="../../images/graphs/growth-all.jpg">first version</a> of
    this graphs, the OpenBSD graph was only estimated, as the RCS
    files of the OpenBSD repository were not publically available and
    inquiries to the OpenBSD project were not answered at the time the
    graphs were generated.  In this version, the data for OpenBSD as
    well as NetBSD and FreeBSD were pulled out of the RCS files, as
    their repositories are fully available now (many thanks to those
    providing that service).
