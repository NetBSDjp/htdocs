<HEADING>NetBSD Package system growth

<LIST>

    The NetBSD Packages Collection celebrated its second birthday
    in October 1999, and it also passed the 1000 package mark during
    that month - we are all grateful to everyone who has helped
    make this possible.

    <p>
    Note: The OpenBSD graph is only estimated, as the RCS files of the
    OpenBSD repository are not publically available and inquiries to the
    OpenBSD project were not answered. The data for FreeBSD as well
    as NetBSD were pulled out of the RCS files, as their repositories
    are fully available (many thanks to those providing that service).
