<HEADING>NetBSD Package system growth

<LIST>

    The NetBSD Packages Collection celebrated its fifth birthday
    in October 2002, and it now contains over 3000 packages!
    We are all grateful to everyone who has helped make this possible.

    <p> Note: In the <a
    href="../../images/graphs/growth-all.png">first version</a> of
    this graphs, the OpenBSD graph was only estimated, as the RCS
    files of the OpenBSD repository were not publically available and
    inquiries to the OpenBSD project were not answered at the time the
    graphs were generated.  In this version, the data for OpenBSD as
    well as NetBSD and FreeBSD were pulled out of the RCS files, as
    their repositories are fully available now (many thanks to those
    providing that service).
