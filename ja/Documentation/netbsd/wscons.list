<HEADING>NetBSD wscons FAQ

<LIST>

<SECTION>The wscons console driver

<ENTRY>wscons What is wscons?
Wscons is the platform-independent workstation console driver for
NetBSD.  As of this writing, not all platforms support wscons, but
more are being added as time goes on.  Wscons should have all the
features (plus some extras) of the old i386 pcvt driver, but its exact
capabilities are dependent on the underlying hardware.

<ENTRY>enablingwscons How do I enable wscons and virtual terminals?
The steps involved in this are:
<ul>
<li>Edit /etc/rc.conf and change "wscons" to "yes"
<li>Edit /etc/ttys entries for ttyE{1,2,3} to "on".
<li>Then either reboot or type the following:
<blockquote>
sh /etc/rc.wscons<br>
kill -1 1<br>
</blockquote>
</ul>
You can then use control-alt-{F1,F2,F3,F4} to switch between the virtual
terminals.

<ENTRY>keyboard-maps Changing the keyboard mapping from 'US'
    This is done with "<tt>wsconsctl</tt>", for example selecting
    a French keyboard map is done via "<b><tt>wsconsctl -w
    encoding=fr</tt></b>".  A full list of keyboard mappings is in
    <CURRENTSRC>/sys/dev/wscons/wsksymdef.h, but some of the more
    common maps are:
    <ul>
	<li><tt>de</tt>
	<li><tt>dk</tt>
	<li><tt>dvorak</tt>
	<li><tt>fr</tt>
	<li><tt>it</tt>
	<li><tt>jp</tt>
	<li><tt>sv</tt>
	<li><tt>swapctrlcaps</tt>
	<li><tt>uk</tt>
	<li><tt>us</tt>
    </ul>
    <p>
    You can change the compiled in kernel default by adding
    <pre>options  PCKBD_LAYOUT=KB_<em>encoding</em></pre> where
    <em>encoding</em> is an uppercase entry from the list above
    (eg: <tt>PCKBD_LAYOUT=KB_FR</tt>).

<ENTRY>screen0 "WSDISPLAYIO_ADDSCREEN: Device busy"
This error message usually occurs when wsconscfg tries to add a screen
which already exists.  One time this occurs is if you have a <code>screen
0</code> line in your <code>/etc/wscons.conf</code> file, because the
kernel always allocates a screen 0 as the console device.  The error
message is harmless in this case, and you can get rid of it by
deleting (or commenting out) the <code>screen 0</code> line.

<ENTRY>enabling-logins Enabling 'login' on additional virtual terminals
As root, edit <tt>/etc/ttys</tt> and switch getty 'on' on ttyE1 to
ttyE3. Change:
<pre>	ttyE1   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         vt220   off secure</pre>
to
<pre>	ttyE1   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         vt220   on secure</pre>
Then 'kill -HUP 1'.

<ENTRY>colors How do I change the text display colors?
Warning and error messages from the kernel, in addition to messages
from the kernel's configuration code, are printed to the console.
When kernel messages show up, they are normally displayed in a
different color, which can be customized.  Look for
<code>WS_KERNEL_FG</code> and <code>WS_KERNEL_BG</code> in your kernel
config file.  Change these to taste, and recompile your kernel.

<ENTRY>muxdevices How do I use the wscons "mux" devices?
The wscons "mux" devices let you multiplex the input streams from more than one
wskbd/wsmouse device.  The multiplexed device for wsmouse devices is
/dev/wsmouse, and for wskbd devices it is /dev/wskbd.  If you configure the X
server to use /dev/wsmouse instead of hardwiring the pointing device, you can
use any wsmouse-compatible pointing device available, or two or more of them
at the same time.
<p>
The steps involved in this are:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Configure and rebuild your kernel
    <ul>
    <li>Add the option "mux 0" to each "wsmouse* at ..." line in your kernel
        config (example: <b>wsmouse* at ums? mux 0</b>).
    <li>Add the option "mux 1" to each "wskbd* at ..." line in your kernel
        config, just like in the example above.
    <li>Make sure you have "<b>pseudo-device wsmux 2</b>" defined in your kernel
        config.
    <li>Build the kernel.  There is a detailed explanation located in the <a
        href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/">Kernel FAQ</a> if
        you're not sure how to do that.
    </ul>

<p>
<li>Make /dev/wsmouse and /dev/wskbd
    <ul>
    <li>As root, cd to /dev and run "./MAKEDEV wsmux".  If it fails, you can
        create these devices by hand in the  /dev directory:
        <dl>
        <dd>mknod wsmouse c 65 0<br>
        <dd>mknod wskbd c 65 1<br>
        <dd>chown root:wheel wsmouse wskbd<br>
        <dd>chmod 600 wsmouse wskbd<br>
        </dl>
    </ul>

<p>
<li>If you're using X, edit /etc/XF86Config
    <ul>
    <li>If the rest of your XF86Config is set up correctly, you can just edit
    the Protocol and Device lines in the "Pointer" section to match the
    following:
    <dl>
    <dd>Protocol "wsmouse"<br>
    <dd>Device "/dev/wsmouse"<br>
    </dl>
    </ul>
</ol>

<p>
After that's done you can do things like use the built-in pointing device on
your laptop PC while on the go, and hot-plug a USB mouse at any later time and
and use it without reconfiguring or restarting the X server.
