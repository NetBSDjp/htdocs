<SECTION>The wscons console driver

<ENTRY>wscons What is wscons?
Wscons is the platform-independent workstation console driver for
NetBSD.  As of this writing, not all platforms support wscons, but
more are being added as time goes on.  Wscons should have all the
features (plus some extras) of the old i386 pcvt driver, but its exact
capabilities are dependent on the underlying hardware.

<ENTRY>screen0 "WSDISPLAYIO_ADDSCREEN: Device busy"
This error message usually occurs when wsconscfg tries to add a screen
which already exists.  One time this occurs is if you have a <code>screen
0</code> line in your <code>/etc/wscons.conf</code> file, because the
kernel always allocates a screen 0 as the console device.  The error
message is harmless in this case, and you can get rid of it by
deleting (or commenting out) the <code>screen 0</code> line.

<ENTRY>colors How do I change the text display colors?
Warning and error messages from the kernel, in addition to messages
from the kernel's configuration code, are printed to the console.
When kernel messages show up, they are normally displayed in a
different color, which can be customized.  Look for
<code>WS_KERNEL_FG</code> and <code>WS_KERNEL_BG</code> in your kernel
config file.  Change these to taste, and recompile your kernel.
