<title>Introduction</title>
<para>The NetBSD package system (<emphasis>pkgsrc</emphasis>)
is a framework for building third-party software on NetBSD and other
UNIX-like systems. It is used to enable such freely available
software to be configured and built easily on supported platforms.</para>

<para>Once the software
has been built, it is manipulated with the pkg_* tools so that installation
and de-installation, printing of an inventory of all installed packages and
retrieval of one-line comments or more verbose descriptions are all
simple.</para>

<para>pkgsrc currently contains over 3500 packages, including:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><pkg>www/apache</pkg> - The Apache web server</listitem>
<listitem><pkg>www/mozilla</pkg> - The Mozilla web browser</listitem>
<listitem><pkg>x11/gnome</pkg> - The GNOME Desktop Environment</listitem>
<listitem><pkg>x11/kde3</pkg> - The K Desktop Environment</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>...just to name a few.</para>

<para>pkgsrc has built-in support for handling varying dependencies,
such as pthreads and X11, and extended features such as IPv6 support on
a range of platforms.</para>

<para>pkgsrc was originally developed on NetBSD, and now supports the
following platforms:</para>

<title>Overview</title>

<para>
This document is divided into two parts.  The first, <link
linkend="users-guide" endterm="users-guide.title"/>,
describes how one can use one of the packages in the Package
Collection, either by installing a precompiled binary package, or
by building one's own copy using the NetBSD package system.  The
second part, <link linkend="developers-guide"
endterm="developers-guide.title"/>, explains how to prepare
a package so it can be easily built by other NetBSD users without
knowing about the package's building details.

<sect1 id="terminology">
<title>Terminology</title>

<para>
There has been a lot of talk about <quote>ports</quote>,
<quote>packages</quote>, etc. so far. Here is a description of all the
terminology used within this document.
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>Package</para>
<para>
A set of files and building instructions that describe what's necessary
to build a certain piece of software using the NetBSD package
system. Packages are traditionally stored under
<filename>/usr/pkgsrc</filename>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>The NetBSD package system</para>
<para>
This is the part of the NetBSD operating system handling building
(compiling), installing, and removing of packages.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Distfile</para>
<para>
This term describes the file or files that are provided by the author
of the piece of freely available software to distribute his work. All
the changes necessary to build on NetBSD are reflected in the
corresponding package. Usually the distfile is in the form of a
compressed tar-archive, but other types are possible, too. Distfiles
are stored below <filename>/usr/pkgsrc/distfiles</filename>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Port</para>
<para>
This is the term used by FreeBSD people for what we call a package.
In NetBSD terminology, <quote>port</quote> refers to a different
architecture.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Precompiled (binary) package</para>
<para>
A set of binaries built by the NetBSD package system from a distfile
using the NetBSD package system and stuffed together in a single .tgz
file so it can be installed on machines of the same machine architecture
without the need to recompile. Packages are generated in
<filename>/usr/pkgsrc/packages</filename> by the NetBSD package system;
there is also an archive on <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/">ftp.NetBSD.org</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
Sometimes, this is referred to by the term <quote>package</quote> too,
especially in the context of precompiled packages.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Program</para>
<para>
The piece of software to be installed which will be constructed from
all the files in the Distfile by the actions defined in the
corresponding package. 
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>NetBSD RCS IDs</para>
<para>
Some files in a package contain RCS IDs to reflect which version of
that file this is (inserted automatically by cvs). These IDs are used
in several examples within this document, but as this document itself
is managed by CVS, it can't list the RCS IDs in plaintext. Instead, the
$s are written as &lt;$&gt;, resulting in &lt;$&gt;NetBSD&lt;$&gt;
and &lt;$&gt;Id&lt;$&gt;.
</para>
</listitem>

<title>Typography</title>

<para>
When giving examples for commands, shell prompts are used to show if the
command should/can be issued as root, or if "normal" user privileges are
sufficient. We use a <quote>#</quote> for root's shell prompt, and a
<quote>%</quote> for users' shell prompt, assuming they use the C-shell
or tcsh.
