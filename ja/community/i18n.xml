    Providing accurate and up to date documentation to all our users is very
    important to the NetBSD Project.  At times, we have attempted to provide
    translations of the documentation on our website into a number of
    languages, but unfortunately it has become obvious that the project is
    lacking the manpower to keep these translations up to date.
  </para>

  <para>
    As we believe that providing outdated documentation may actually be more
    harmful than only providing English content, we have decided to no longer
    maintain non-English documentation in our ``htdocs'' repository or on
    our website.
  </para>

  <para>
    At the same time, we are fully aware of the importance of
    internationalized documentation and welcome community efforts of providing
    such translations.
    If you are working on translations of our website and
    are hosting these pages on your own server, please <ulink
    url="mailto:www@NetBSD.org">let us know</ulink>.
