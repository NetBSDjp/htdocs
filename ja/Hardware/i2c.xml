<para>
The I2C bus is a standard serial bus used as an interconnect between
components on a device.  This is a support bus, and does not export
an interface to the user.  However, having this generic I2C support can
aid device driver writers, as they will not have to re-implement I2C
support code if their device uses I2C.
