<para>
The I2C bus is a standard serial bus used as an interconnect between
components on a device.  This is a support bus, and does not export
an interface to the user.  However, having this generic I2C support can
aid device driver writers, as they will not have to re-implement I2C
support code if their device uses I2C.

Please note that these pages reflect the state of NetBSD-current. To check
the supported hardware list for a specific release of NetBSD, check
that release's installation notes.
If you are unsure, please boot a -current kernel or send mail to
