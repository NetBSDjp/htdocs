<title>Machine-independent OpenFirmware drivers</title>

<para>
The following devices (<emphasis>driver name in parentheses</emphasis>) are supported by
machine-independent OpenFirmware drivers.  If you do not see your device listed here,
check your platform's page; there may not yet be a machine-independent driver
for your device.
</para>

<para>
Alternatively, it may be the case that your device is compatible with one
listed here, or your device may not be listed due to an oversight.  If you
are unsure, please send mail to
<email>netbsd-help@NetBSD.org</email>.
</para>

<para>
OpenFirmware drivers are often used for bootstrapping a NetBSD port
to a platform which has OpenFirmware.  It allows devices to be used,
via firmware callbacks, while device drivers for the interrupt controllers,
custom chips, etc. are in development.
</para>

<para>
Please note that these pages reflect the state of NetBSD-current. To check
the supported hardware list for a specific release of NetBSD, check
that release's installation notes.
