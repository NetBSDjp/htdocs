<h1>NetBSD/mac68k To-Do List</h1>

<p> There are a number of things that need to be done.  To work on just
about any of them, you'll need to have a working NetBSD/mac68k system
or at least a cross-compliation system (see the 
<a href="http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/howto/cc-HOWTO">NetBSD/mac68k
cross-compiler HOWTO</a> for information on setting this up). </p>

<p> <em>Note:</em> The items on these lists can (and will) be tackled in
any order.  The system is basically usable on several platforms and the
people working on it are doing so because they want to.  If you see
something you want done, do it! </p> 

<p>
There are several categories of items here:
<ol>
  <li> <b><a href="#basic">Basic</a></b> -- stuff that should be done to
      make NetBSD/mac68k more of a full system. </li>
  <li> <b><a href="#interesting">Interesting</a></b> -- Reasonable
      enhancements. </li>
  <li> <b><a href="#fun">"Fun"</a></b> -- Further out.  Lots of work. </li>
</ol>

This list is by no means complete.  If you have anything to add, or would
like to find out if something is being worked on, please contact
<a href="mailto:scottr@NetBSD.ORG">Scott Reynolds</a>.
If you'd like to see support for some specific hardware or platform,
but don't have the expertise to do it yourself, keep in mind that a
<a href="../../contrib/donations.html">loan or donation</a>
might help interest someone else in doing it.

<p>
