<ENTRY>ss5.1 5.1 Reporting problems with send-pr

The send-pr utility is the proper way to submit bug reports and change
requests.  It should exist on your NetBSD system and should work fine if
you have e-mail set up on your system. If you don't have e-mail set up, you
can use send-pr to create a bug report which you can then cut & paste or
otherwise transfer to a system from which you can send e-mail.
Alternatively, you can use the online version of send-pr available the
NetBSD website:
<p>

<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/send-pr.html">http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/send-pr.html</a>
<p>

Using send-pr ensures that the report will be recorded in the GNATS
database.  It can be used to submit any bug (documentation or
programmatic) or change request or fix.
<p>

Currently, there are no open bugs filed in category port-mac, but there are
a few in port-mac68k.  I know that there are more bugs than those that have
been filed, though.  The example pr, below, for example, is not entirely
made up.
<p>

When submitting a bug with send-pr, please be as detailed as you can and
fill out all blanks to the best of your knowledge.  The proper category
for NetBSD/mac68k bugs that are mac-specific would be port-mac68k.  Here's
an example of a filled out bug report:
<p>

   Where does all my time go?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netbsd.org/&quot;&gt;Guess.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&gt;Confidential:  no
&gt;Synopsis:      Under high traffic conditions, the ae driver locks the system.
&gt;Severity:      serious
&gt;Priority:      medium
&gt;Category:      port-mac68k
&gt;Class:         sw-bug
&gt;Release:       Wed Sep 20 1995
&gt;Environment:
        Mac IIcx with 20MB.  Should affect all systems running the ae driver.
System: NetBSD puma.bevd.blacksburg.va.us 1.0A NetBSD 1.0A (PUMA) #35: Wed Sep 2
0 19:56:59 EDT 1995 briggs@puma.bevd.blacksburg.va.us:/u/home/briggs/bsd/src/sys
/arch/mac68k/compile/PUMA mac68k


&gt;Description:
        Under heavy network traffic, the ae driver will wedge the
system.  When this happens, no input works--from the keyboard nor from
the network.  I did not try from a serial console.
&gt;How-To-Repeat:
        In my case, running tcpdump on a busy network caused the system
to freeze.  The exact command was: 'tcpdump -eln'
&gt;Fix:
        No fix, yet, but I suspect that the fix lies in the via nubus
interrupt handling code, not in the ethernet driver, per se.
