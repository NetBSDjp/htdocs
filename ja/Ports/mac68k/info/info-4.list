<h1>4. Known Problems &amp; Solutions</h1>

<LIST>

<hr>
<p>

This section is not for bugs.  It is for things such as system limitations
that might have work-arounds.

<ENTRY>ss4.1 4.1 SCSI difficulties

Many users have reported filesystem corruption under NetBSD.  Symptoms
include mysterious hangs and the transformation of numerous files from
executable binaries into device files.  The problem seems to plague Quantum
drives more often than other models.  This problem only happens
on '030-based Macs using the ncrscsi driver.
<p>

Although this problem is technically a bug in the ncrscsi driver, it does
have a workaround.  The solution is to change to a kernel using the sbc
SCSI driver instead.  One of these kernels is available from:

<ENTRY>ss4.2 4.2 Installer dies during install with the error: <code>Error on SCSIRead(), #5</code>

The most recent version of the Installer (1.1g as of this writing) still
has difficulties with partitions on large drives (i.e. greater than 1GB in
size).  The problems seem to occur most often on Quantum Fireball drives (I
don't believe that it is limited to them), but the key factors seem to
revolve around having partitions (often large partitions) located on the
upper portion of the disk (i.e. beyond the first 1GB of the disk) and
writing large distribution sets to these partitions (smaller sets often
complete, but the base distribution set will often die).  A similar bug in
the Installer was fixed a while ago, but this one appears to be slightly
different.
<p>

There are a few workarounds.  The first thing to try is to increase the
amount of memory allocated to the Installer to as much as you can give it.
The next thing to try is to move your NetBSD partitions to the start of the
drive (or as close to it as possible).  If this doesn't work, you'll need
to install as many distribution sets as you can using the Installer, then
use the Installer's Mini-Shell to copy in the distribution sets to your
NetBSD partition, and finally finish installing the sets from within
NetBSD.<p>

This problem is discussed in detail in the
<a href="../faq/">FAQ</a>.

<ENTRY>ss4.3 4.3 Boot hangs while recognizing ethernet or video card

This problem is usually a result of a conflict between ethernet and video
cards.  One possible solution is to simply reorder the cards in their
slots.  If this does not work, try removing whichever card you cannot live
without and see if the boot sequence stops hanging.
<p>

If you're boot sequence is hanging merely because of a video card, chances
are the kernel is not yet properly clearing the interrupts for your card.
There is a HOWTO for locating the information necessary for doing this:
<p>

<a href="http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/howto/video.html">http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/howto/video.html</a>
<p>

With the proper information, changes can be made to the kernel to allow
your machine to boot without having to remove the card.

<ENTRY>ss4.4 4.4 Problems with Mkfs 1.4 recognizing the last partition on the drive

The symptoms of this problem are that you have created a partition of
whatever type that you want to convert into a NetBSD partition, but Mkfs
1.4 refuses to recognize the partition.
<p>

This problem is caused by an off-by-one error in the Partition Map which is
created by several hard drive formatters (including the latest HD SC setup
from Apple).  Basically, the number of Partition Map entries is one greater
than the reported size of the Map.  Mkfs 1.4 ignores this last entry (and
rightly so, since it might be the Driver Partition in a correctly formatted
drive).
<p>

The solution is to upgrade to Mkfs 1.45 or later where this bug is fixed.
If you cannot locate Mkfs 1.45 or later, you have two choices.  You can
either use a formatter which correctly writes the Partition Map or else you
can  place a small partition at the end of the disk. If you are going to
keep a MacOS partition around, this is an excellent place to put one.  On
the other hand, if you'd rather conserve space, a 1 kB Scratch partition at
the end of the disk should also work.
