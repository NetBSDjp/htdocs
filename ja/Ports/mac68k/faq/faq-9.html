<A NAME="x-window"></A> <H1>9. <A NAME="s9"></A>X Window System Version 11 Release 6</H1>
<P>
<HR>
<A HREF="faq.html#toc9">Contents of this section</A><HR>
</P>

<A NAME="G.H"></A> <H2>9.1 <A NAME="ss9.1"></A> Now I've got NetBSD working, so where do I get X? </H2>

<P>The X Window System is now included as part of the NetBSD distribution as
of the NetBSD 1.2 release.  You'll want the latest version, so you can pick
up the files form the following directory:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3/mac68k/binary/sets/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3/mac68k/binary/sets/</A>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>xbase.tgz</CODE> file is the base distribution, including the X binaries,
shared libraries and some of the configuration files.  The <CODE>xcomp.tgz</CODE>
file includes those items needed for compiling X binaries such as the
static libraries and header files.  The <CODE>xfont.tgz</CODE> set includes the X11
fonts.  The <CODE>xcontrib.tgz</CODE> set consists of the binaries and man pages
from the X "contrib" directory (e.g. xload, xev).  Finally, the
<CODE>xserver.tgz</CODE> file is the X server binary itself.  Install these files
using your favorite method (i.e. either the Installer utility or from
within NetBSD).  They will unarchive into the various subdirectories of
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/</CODE>. </P>
<P>The distribution X server is a monochrome server.  In order to use it, your
machine <EM>must</EM> be in 1-bit (i.e. B&amp;W) mode before booting NetBSD.
The NetBSD 1.3 X server provides a number of improvements over the 1.2
server, so you will probably want to upgrade if you are using the older
binaries.</P>
<P>If you have trouble getting X to run, try starting it with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
startx &gt;&amp; startx.log
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will capture any error messages in the file <CODE>startx.log</CODE> so that
you can examine it to determine the cause of the problem.</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.S"></A> <H2>9.2 <A NAME="ss9.2"></A> When I type <CODE>startx</CODE> I get the message: <CODE>startx: Command not found.</CODE> What's wrong?</H2>

<P>You need to add the location of the X binaries to your shell's <CODE>path</CODE>
variable.  For <CODE>csh</CODE> and its derivatives, add <CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin</CODE> to
the line in your <CODE>.cshrc</CODE> file which sets the <CODE>path</CODE> variable.  For
<CODE>sh</CODE> and its derivatives, you'll need to modify you <CODE>.profile</CODE>
instaed. </P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.J"></A> <H2>9.3 <A NAME="ss9.3"></A> I can't get X to run.  Does this have anything to do with having a read-only filesystem?</H2>

<P>X will not run in single-user mode to the best of my knowledge, because I 
don't think that the necessary daemons to manage the port connections it
must have to run have been started at that point.  You need to exit from
single-user mode (type exit or hit Ctrl-D), which will then run /etc/rc*,
mount the listed filesystems read-write (or whatever you happen to
specify), and then put you into multi-user mode from which you can run X by
typing <CODE>startx</CODE>.</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.A"></A> <H2>9.4 <A NAME="ss9.4"></A> After I type <CODE>startx</CODE> something weird happened: I got six really    tiny screens on the top of my monitor.  Can anyone help me with this one?</H2>

<P>The problem is that your monitor is not in 1-bit (black &amp; white) mode
and the kernel and NetBSD/mac68k X server that you are using do not support
color.  You need to remember to set your monitor to 1-bit mode before you boot NetBSD.</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.B"></A> <H2>9.5 <A NAME="ss9.5"></A> When I type <CODE>startx</CODE> I get the message: <CODE>xinit: libXmu.so.6.0 not found</CODE>. What's wrong?</H2>

<P>The reason you are having trouble is that you have not made the dynamic
link editor aware that the X libraries exist.  To do so you need to modify
<CODE>var/run/ld.so.hints</CODE> using <CODE>ldconfig</CODE>.</P>
<P>If you have the new-style (i.e. post-1.2) configuration files, you can edit
<CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE> to contain the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 /usr/X11R6/lib
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you are using the older method, you should edit <CODE>/etc/rc.local</CODE>
to contain a line similar to the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#
# Build the link-editor fast directory cache.
#
echo &quot;adding X libraries to the runtime link editor directory cache.&quot;
ldconfig -m /usr/X11R6/lib
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Much thanks to Jim Wise (jim@santafe.arch.columbia.edu) for the hint about
the <CODE>-m</CODE> flag to <CODE>ldconfig</CODE>.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that the above examples assume that your X shared libraries
are located in <CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib</CODE>.  If you have moved them elsewhere,
use that location instead.</P>
<P>Although you can generally use the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> to override or
extend the list of libraries cached by <CODE>ldconfig</CODE>, the X server is a
setuid program, so it will ignore any such attempts in this case.  See
<CODE>ldconfig(8)</CODE> for details.</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.M"></A> <H2>9.6 <A NAME="ss9.6"></A> When I type <CODE>startx</CODE> I get the message: <CODE>xinit: libXext.so.6.1 not found</CODE>. What's wrong?</H2>

<P>See the 
<A HREF="#G.B">previous answer</A>
</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.C"></A> <H2>9.7 <A NAME="ss9.7"></A> When starting X, I get <CODE>"ld.so: warning: libm.so.0.0: minor version >= 1 expected, using it anyway"</CODE>.  Should I worry about this?</H2>

<P>The reason why you are getting this error is that the X server was compiled
with a newer version of the shared libraries than you currently have on
your system.  You are probably using the 1.0 or 1.1 distribution shared
libs.  You need to update your shared libraries to fix this problem.</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.D"></A> <H2>9.8 <A NAME="ss9.8"></A> When starting X, I get <CODE>"ld.so: Undefined symbol "__sys_errlist" in X:X"</CODE>, and then X just dies.  What am I doing wrong?</H2>

<P>The problem here is the same as for the question above, you are using an
outdated version of the shared libraries.  You need to update these
libraries by finding a newer version of the base distribution tar file or
else compile your own libraries from the current source.</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.E"></A> <H2>9.9 <A NAME="ss9.9"></A> When using X and fvwm, I've noticed that the mouse tends to wrap around the left side of the screen.  What's up?</H2>

<P>This is a problem with the first two MacBSD X servers.  You need to upgrade
your X binaries.  For the latest sets, take a look at:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3/mac68k/binary/sets/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3/mac68k/binary/sets/</A>
</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.F"></A> <H2>9.10 <A NAME="ss9.10"></A> After using X for several hours, I've noticed that certain keys, such as the arrow keys or the 'a' key stop working.  Is there a fix?</H2>

<P>This is a problem with the first two MacBSD X servers.  Basically, the 'a'
key was bound to keycode 0, something which is not recommended for an X
server to do. You need to upgrade your X binaries.  For the latest sets,
take a look at: </P>

<A NAME="G.G"></A> <H2>9.11 <A NAME="ss9.11"></A> I have two monitors, but how can I get xterms and stuff to come up on the second monitor?</H2>

<P>Try using the <CODE>-display</CODE> flag for the X client in question like so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
xterm -display :0.1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This makes the client connect to display 0, screen 1 of the current
machine.  Alternatively, most window managers have menus that are attached
to the root window.  If you have a menu which will execute clients, then
you can start them up in the second monitor by using the proper client from
the menu.</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.I"></A> <H2>9.12 <A NAME="ss9.12"></A> What's wrong with the up and down arrow keys under X? </H2>

<P>This problem appears to be fixed as of the NetBSD 1.3 X distribution.
Please obtain a copy of it and install it.  An explanation of the problem
and a workaround for those using older X distributions follows.</P>
<P>The left and right arrow keys, in conjunction with the option key, are used
for emulation of the second and third mouse buttons.  This seems to
conflict with the up and down arrow keys under X, but a simple fix exists:</P>

<A NAME="G.K"></A> <H2>9.13 <A NAME="ss9.13"></A> I've noticed the the speaker no longer seems to beep when I'm running X.  What's wrong?</H2>

<P>You're using an outdated X distribution.  Apparently, sound support for X
is a rather difficult thing to provide, however, Scott Reynolds
(scottr@og.org) managed to include it in the NetBSD 1.3 X release:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3/binary/sets/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3/binary/sets/</A>
</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.L"></A> <H2>9.14 <A NAME="ss9.14"></A> Black &amp; White X Windows is cool, but what about color?</H2>

<P>It depends on your hardware.  Thanks to original efforts by Ken Nakata
(kenn@eden.rutgers.edu) and Taras Ivanenko (ivanenko@ctpa03.mit.edu) and
further work by Paul Goyette (paul@whooppee.com) there is 8-bit color
support for Nubus video on some '030 and '040-based Macs.</P>
<P>NOTE:  in addition to the information provided below, you may want to check
out Mark Andres' (mark@giganet.net) color X HOWTO:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www2.giganet.net/~mark/NetBSD/howtos/color-x-howto.html">http://www2.giganet.net/~mark/NetBSD/howtos/color-x-howto.html</A>
</P>
<P>In order to run in color you need two things:  kernel support for color
video and an X server which understands this support.  You can obtain a
color-capable X server which is compatible with the NetBSD 1.3 X
distribution from the following location:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.macbsd.com/pub/NetBSD/X/Xmac68k_color.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.macbsd.com/pub/NetBSD/X/Xmac68k_color.tar.gz</A>
</P>
<P>If you need a color-capable server for the older NetBSD 1.2 X distribution,
please check the <CODE>old/</CODE> subdirectory of the above directory.</P>
<P>Please read the associated README file for the X server.  In addition, some
information from Ken Nakata on the features of the new X server: </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Its new feature is in its grf initialization scheme when you are
running a non-color kernel.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It first tries to initialize grf in 8-bpp mode, and then tries 1-bpp
if 8-bpp fails.  Both attempts use Taras' grf driver ioctl() calls, so
neither will work if you have a GENERIC kernel (or whatever without
Taras' grf driver built in).  The older colorkit server gave up on it
here, but the new server does more: It GUESSES that the running kernel
doesn't have Taras' driver in it, and it ASSUMES that the grf is
already in 1-bpp mode, so it starts in 1-bpp mode.  You'll lose if you
booted NetBSD in other than 1-bpp mode, but you would have lost even
with the older colorkit servers anyway.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A Colorkit Misconception Warning: If you run a kernel with Taras' grf
driver and this server, you don't have to boot NetBSD in any
particular pixel depth.  The server tries 8-bpp first, then 1-bpp if
your video doesn't support 8-bpp no matter in what video mode you
booted.  In other words, X won't run in any other pixel depth even if
you explicitly boot NetBSD in that depth.  Why not support 4-, 16-, or
even 24-bpp modes?  Frankly, that's out of range for my skills, and I
don't personally want them that much.  Sorry.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To summarize, this X server should work on <EM>both</EM> monochrome and color
kernels, and it supports the terminal beep.  So, this X server is probably
my server of choice.</P>
<P>If you install the color X server as something other than
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin/Xmac68k</CODE> (the default), you will need to create a
symbolic link from it to <CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin/X</CODE> so that <CODE>startx</CODE> will
start the correct binary.</P>
<P>There are two methods of adding kernel support for color video.  The older
of the two is to use the the colorkit loadable kernel module.  A version
that works with NetBSD 1.3 and later should be available at:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.macbsd.com/pub/NetBSD/X/video_lkm/video_lkm_combined.o">ftp://ftp.macbsd.com/pub/NetBSD/X/video_lkm/video_lkm_combined.o</A>
</P>
<P>In order for the colorkit LKM to work, you must load it into the kernel.
If you have a recent kernel, the kernel-level support for LKM's is already
built-in.  If you are using an older (i.e. 1.2 or earlier kernel, you'll
have to compile your own kernel with LKM support added, or, better yet,
upgrade to 1.3). First, install the object file into <CODE>/usr/lkm</CODE>.
Then, if you have the new <CODE>/etc/lkm.conf</CODE>, simply edit it to look
something like the following: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#       $NetBSD: faq-9.html,v 1.3 1999/05/02 13:20:54 kenn Exp $
#
# see lkm.conf(5) for details.  path will look in /lkm and /usr/lkm.
#
# path          options         entry           postinstall     output  when
video_lkm_combined.o    -       video_lkm_cmd   -       /tmp/video      -
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you are not using the new <CODE>/etc/lkm.conf</CODE> file, you should
upgrade your /etc directory.  Or, you can add something like the following
to the end of <CODE>/etc/rc.local</CODE>: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# Set up color video
if [ -f /usr/lkm/video_lkm_combined.o ] ; then
        echo 'loading color video.'
        modload -o /tmp/video -e video_lkm_cmd video_lkm_combined.o
fi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You could also issue the above command by hand, but remember that you must
be in single-user mode to successfully execute <CODE>modload</CODE> unless you have
<CODE>options INSECURE</CODE> specified in you kernel configuration.  A third
option is to obtain the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.macbsd.com/pub/NetBSD/X/video_lkm.tar.gz">colorkit LKM source</A>
,
compile and/or install the LKM, and issue a <CODE>make load</CODE> command from the
compile directory (while in single-user of course).</P>
<P>One caveat for using the colorkit LKM is that the module does not unload
gracefully, so if you shutdown the system from multi-user into single-user
and try to load the LKM again, it will most likely hang the system.</P>
<P>The second option for adding kernel support for color video is to get one
of Paul Goyette's SLOTMAN kernels or to compile your own kernel with his
SLOTMAN patches added.  You can obtain both from:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.whooppee.com/pub/slotman/">ftp://ftp.whooppee.com/pub/slotman/</A>
</P>
<P>This method is recommended over using the LKM since the SLOTMAN changes
support a wider variety of video hardware because it contains a more
complete implementation of the Slot Manager than does the LKM.  A list of
machines supported by the SLOTMAN changes should be available in the same
directory listed above.  Please contact Paul (paul@whooppee.com) for
further information if your machine is not on his supported list</P>
<P>As for color on Macs with internal video only, support is in the works by
Michael Zucca (mrz5149@rit.cs.rit.edu).  As a result, none of
the '040-based Macs will currently support color X windows with their
onboard video.  Check out Michael's project page for the status of this
effort:

<A NAME="G.N"></A> <H2>9.15 <A NAME="ss9.15"></A> When starting X, I get <CODE>Fatal server error:  Can't run X server with no screens!</CODE>, and then X just dies.  What am I doing wrong?</H2>

<P>This is probably due to lack of support for your video hardware in the
kernel you are using.  Not all internal video hardware is supported yet,
nor are all nubus video boards.  Use the <CODE>dmesg</CODE> command to search your
boot message for a line beginning with <CODE>grf0</CODE>.  If you don't see such a
line, you are currently out of luck (unless there is some experimental
kernel with the support you need built into it).</P>
<P>If you do see such a line, then you probably forgot to make devices.  As
root, <CODE>cd</CODE> into the <CODE>/dev</CODE> directory and do a
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
sh MAKEDEV grf0 grf1 grf2 grf3
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to make the appropriate devices.  Hopefully, this will solve your problem.</P>
<P>Thanks to Ken Nakata (kenn@eden.rutgers.edu) for the above solution.</P>

<A NAME="G.O"></A> <H2>9.16 <A NAME="ss9.16"></A> I like X, but my German keyboard makes things a bit difficult.  Is there a fix?</H2>

<P>Yes, Hauke Fath (hauke@Espresso.Rhein-Neckar.DE) has contributed a German
xmodmaprc file.  It is available at:

<A NAME="G.P"></A> <H2>9.17 <A NAME="ss9.17"></A> When I start X, I get the error: <CODE>/dev/grf2: not found</CODE>. What's wrong?</H2>

<P>You are probably running on an older system with at least 2 monitors
attached.  Either way, X servers later than September 1995 perform a couple
of checks, one of which results in trying to open <CODE>/dev/grf2</CODE>.  If
this fails, the X server will die.</P>
<P>To fix this, you need to create the device file.  As root, <CODE>cd</CODE> to the
<CODE>/dev</CODE> directory and type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
sh MAKEDEV grf2 grf3
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the above fails, you need to get a newer version of the MAKEDEV script
(the 1.2 distribution or later should have it).</P>
<P>Thanks to Ken Nakata (kenn@eden.rutgers.edu) and Allen Briggs
(briggs@puma.macbsd.com) for the answer and the fix.</P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.Q"></A> <H2>9.18 <A NAME="ss9.18"></A> How do I keep console messages from messing up my X screen?</H2>

<P>You need to either run xconsole or else run an xterm with the "-C" option.
Even then, you need to have the
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
options         UCONSOLE
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

line uncommented in your config file (the GENERIC config is set up this
way).  Due to a bug in xconsole, you may also need to have your X startup
scripts <CODE>chown</CODE> the console to yourself and make it readable by you.</P>
<P>You can also edit <CODE>/etc/syslog.conf</CODE> to redirect syslog output to
wherever you would like it to go.</P>
<P>Thanks to David Brownlee (abs@anim.dreamworks.com) for this answer.</P>

<A NAME="G.R"></A> <H2>9.19 <A NAME="ss9.19"></A> After upgrading everything but my X server, I get strange error messages about fonts.  How can I fix this?</H2>

<P>The problem you are encountering is due to the fact that the new 1.3 X
distribution uses gzipped fonts because it is XFree86 3.3-based, while the
older distributions used compressed fonts because they were X11R6.1-based.
A new server should be backwards compatible, but the old server won't be
able to use the newer fonts. </P>
<P>The solution is to upgrade all your X binaries at once, including the X
server.  If you didn't upgrade the X server because you were using the older
color server, there is a new one available that is compatible with the 1.3
X distribution:</P>

<A NAME="G.T"></A> <H2>9.20 <A NAME="ss9.20"></A> When I try to start X, my machine appears to hang.  What am I doing wrong?</H2>

<P>Assuming that your machine supports X (and most machines which will boot on
their own console do), chances are you just aren't waiting long enough for
the magic to happen.  On machines which lack an FPU and are low on memory
(e.g. an LCII), it can take several minutes (like 20+) for X to start.  So,
just sit back and wait a while.</P>
<P>If you machine is hanging with the gray hatched background and the black X
cursor in the foreground, it might be that you need to setup a .xinitrc
file which will start X clients for you (although by default you should at
least get an xterm if your path is set correctly).  Please read the
<CODE>X(1)</CODE> and <CODE>xinit(1)</CODE> man pages for more info on how to configure X
to your tastes. </P>
<P></P>

<A NAME="G.U"></A> <H2>9.21 <A NAME="ss9.21"></A> When I start X, everything runs in lovely shades of pink and yellow.  What's wrong?</H2>

<P>You have booted into NetBSD without setting your screen to 1-bit mode
first, and you are using the color X server, but color X isn't supported
under your current setup.  The colors you are seeing a probably a result of
the server using whatever colors happen to be in your CLUT at the time you
booted NetBSD.  If you have a supported NuBus video card, you need to see
the Q&amp;A above on setting up 
<A HREF="#G.L">color X</A>
.  Otherwise,
you need to
