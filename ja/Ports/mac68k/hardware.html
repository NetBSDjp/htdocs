Supported Hardware</H1>
<em>NetBSD is as useful and as good as its users make it.</em>

<p>If you are interested in helping with something, take a look at the
<A HREF="todo.html">list of things to do</A> and choose something! </p>

<P>NetBSD works with a growing number of the older Macs.  Take a look at
the <a href="curr_info.html">Current Information page</a> or join the
<A HREF="/MailingLists/index.html#port-mac68k">port-mac68k mailing list</A>
for the most current information. Also check out the
<A HREF="http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/macbsd-docs/machine-status/">machine-status document</A>
and the <A HREF="http://www.macbsd.com/~spearce/index.html">user survey</A>.

<P>Finally, the NetBSD/mac68k <A HREF="info/info.html">Operating System
Information</A> document provides a list of working hardware and software,
as well as descriptions of known bugs and common problems.
<H3>
<A NAME="powermacs">What about the PowerMacs?</a></H3>
Although they share a few bits of hardware, the PowerMacs are a
<I>completely</I> different architecture than their 68k cousins, and you
can not run NetBSD/mac68k on them. The 68k-emulator does emulate the 68k
processor very well for MacOS applications, but it is not sufficient to run
NetBSD/mac68k for several reasons.

<p>
Fortunately, there is now a native port of NetBSD that will run on many of
the PowerMac models.  There is no formal release for NetBSD/macppc as of
yet, but you can find the port in NetBSD-current.  Please see the
<a href="http://nandra.iri.co.jp/NetBSD/macppc.html">NetBSD/macppc web
page</a> for more details on the current state of the port.
