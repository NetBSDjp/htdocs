<ENTRY>ss1.1 1.1 Introduction

<b>What is MacBSD?</b>
<p>

MacBSD, or NetBSD/mac68k as it is more properly known, is a port of NetBSD
to the Apple Macintosh platform.  NetBSD is a largely POSIX.1 compliant
UNIX-like operating system based on the BSD 4.4 Lite distribution from the
University of California, Berkeley.  NetBSD comes with its own source code
and for the most part is distributed under the Berkeley software license.
Other portions are distributed under the Gnu General Public License.
<p>

NetBSD/mac68k currently runs on older model Macintoshes with a 68040 or
68030 processor (or a 68020 with a PMMU).  It will boot on machines without
an FPU but some software still requires an FPU. Support for 68LC040-based
Macs is still in progress.
