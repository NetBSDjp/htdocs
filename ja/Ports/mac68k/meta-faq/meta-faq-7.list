<ENTRY>ss7.1 7.1 Keeping up with -current

NetBSD-current is a daily snapshot of the NetBSD development source
tree. Because it is "work in progress," it may not be particularly well
tested, and it may not even compile. People developing drivers and other
system-level software for NetBSD are encouraged to run NetBSD-current, as
are people who want to be on the bleeding edge of NetBSD development. If
you're just using NetBSD for day-to-day work, you should probably be
running a formal release of NetBSD instead.
<p>

NetBSD-current is available via anonymous FTP and SUP. Current sources can
be found in the NetBSD-current area directly off the "root" of the NetBSD
area on FTP mirrors. NetBSD-current has it's own set of SUP collections,
but those collections may differ from one SUP server to another; see the
individual servers' README files for more information.
