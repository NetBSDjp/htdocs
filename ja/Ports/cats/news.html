<dt><b>2002-09-13:</b> New firmware for cats.
    <dd>Simtec have released new firmware for cats, I recommend that people
    install it.  It's been noted that it has fixed an issue relating to X on
    for at least one person.<br>
    The new firmware can be found on Simtec's
    <a href="http://www.simtec.co.uk/">website</a>.
    Specifically on their cats support
    <a href="http://www.simtec.co.uk/products/EB110ATX/resources.html">page</a>.
    I would strongly recommend that cats users upgrade to 1.3.
    As the firmware allows for larger kernels, which means I'll be reenabling
    some devices in the -current INSTALL kernel.

<dt><b>2002-08-04:</b> X support for cats.
    <dd>NetBSD/cats now has in tree support for xfree86 4.2.0.  Sets haven't
    been built yet, but anyone wishing to try X needs to update to the latest
    xsrc. Note that you need 1.6BETA or 1.6 -current as the server uses the
    /dev/pci0 interface.  Non-current users will need to add USE_XF86_4=YES to
    /etc/mk.conf.<br>
    Note I'll be requesting pullups to 1.6, but they may not make it into
    1.6.0.
    <br>
    <b>Update 2002-08-19:</b> Sets for 1.6 RC1 are now available from
    ftp.NetBSD.org, in /pub/NetBSD/arch/cats/xsets  The mirrors will probably
    pick it up in the near future.

<dt><b>2002-07-29:</b> Cats now has a mailing list
    <dd>NetBSD/cats now has its own mailing list, port-cats.  The list is
    for discussion
    of both cats and EBSA boards and issues relating to them.  Generic arm
    issues should still goto the port-arm list.  To subscribe use the links on
    the side.

<dt><b>2001-06-10:</b> Cats moves to its own arch dir
    <dd>NetBSD/cats is now in its own arch dir,
    <a href="http://cvsweb.NetBSD.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sys/arch/cats/">sys/arch
/cats</a>
    Kernels should be built from there.  Note that GENERIC has grown as it now
    contains all the currently supported USB devices.
     
    Any cats specific bugs should be reported using the newly created
    port-cats category in send-pr.
