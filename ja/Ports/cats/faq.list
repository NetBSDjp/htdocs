<p>

This is the FAQ list for the NetBSD/cats port of NetBSD.

<LIST>

<SECTION>General Information

<ENTRY>sup_perip What peripherals are supported?
You should be able to use any PCI card that NetBSD supports
(except for those that have 'machine dependent' requirements). Take a look at
the <a href="../../Hardware/">supported hardware</a> pages.

<ENTRY>perip_cats_2nd_com How can I use the secondary com port?
On CATS, the secondary com port is connected to footbridge com port,
not com1 port at ISA. You need to create a device node for it by
<code>mknod(8)</code> command, as <code>"mknod /dev/fcom0 c 54 0"</code>. Note
that on NetBSD 1.6 or later you can use <code>"cd /dev; ./MAKEDEV
fcom0"</code>.


<ENTRY>perip_cats_serial_cons On my CATS, how can I use serial console?
The Cyclone firmware on CATS supports serial console by default and it uses
the secondary (footbridge) com port, which is mentioned in the previous entry.
NetBSD/cats kernel also supports serial console on footbridge com.
Make kernel without vga configuration or specify boot args at the
firmware prompt like
<code>"boot&gt; boot wd0a:/netbsd <strong>console=fcom</strong>"</code>,
and then kernel choose to use footbridge com for its console.
