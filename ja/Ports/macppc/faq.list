<SECTION>General Problems/Questions


<ENTRY>boot-trouble Help, I can't boot NetBSD!
Unfortunately, there are several causes of this problem.  It's actually rather 
more common than we'd like, but is primarily due to the variety of machines
that we support and all the undocumented changes Apple made along the line.

<p>First, check to make sure your <a href="models.html">model</a> is supported.
Next, did you <i>really</i> read through the INSTALL notes and ignore
the instructions for Open Firmware versions other than your model? 
Next, read through this FAQ entry, and if you still can't make your machine
boot into NetBSD, post to 
<a href="mailto:port-macppc@netbsd.org">port-macppc@netbsd.org</a>.

<p>Look at the messages below to determine which problem you are encountering.

<p>
<pre>     Open Firmware, 1.0.5
     To continue booting the MacOS type:
     BYE&lt;return&gt;
     To continue booting from the default boot device type:
     BOOT&lt;return&gt;
      ok
     0 &gt; </pre>

If you don't see this message on screen (or serial console), then you
haven't properly entered Open Firmware.  If your machine starts to boot
MacOS (i.e.  the screen turns grey and a happy mac, broken folder, or
flashing question mark appears), then skip down to <a
href="#ofw-access">How do I get to the Open Firmware prompt?</a>.  If your
screen stays black and you have an older mac, see <a
href="#ofw-boot-serial">it just stopped booting, and my monitor isn't
showing anything</a>. If your screen is all weird, then see how to fix the
<a href="#non-sync-monitor">monitor sync problems</a>. 

<p>OK, now Open Firmware has started and is ready for user commands if you
set it to stop at the Open Firmware prompt (the "<tt>0&nbsp;&gt;</tt>").
If you specified that it not stop, Open Firmware tries to boot using the
settings you previously supplied (the Open Firmware variables
<tt>boot-command</tt>, <tt>boot-device</tt>, and <tt>boot-file</tt>). 
See <a href="#ofw-use">What can I do at the Open Firmware prompt?</a> for help 
using the Open Firmware command line interface.

<p>The next step is usually the trickiest -- getting Open Firmware to load
the bootloader from the correct location.  See what 
<a href="#boot-support">boot methods</a> are supported, Open Firmware 
<a href="#boot-disk">boot commands</a>, and some 
<a href="#common-of-probs">common Open Firmware booting problems</a>. 
Questions related to netbooting are covered in the 
<a href="../../Documentation/network/netboot/">Diskless HOW-TO</a>, 
particularly in the 
<a href="../../Documentation/network/netboot/intro.macppc.html">macppc-specific</a>
section, and the section on <a href="#netboot-probs">common netboot 
problems</a>.

If it hangs here, then you need to set the

or 2.0.x machine. If you get past this point, then your kernel has started
to load.  Now, if you have problems, it is most likely no longer an Open
Firmware problem, but a NetBSD problem. 

<p>If you have a PowerBook (FireWire) or a PowerBook G4 (Titanium) and you 
experience a hang here, then read about the <a href="#pb418">4.1.8 BootROM</a>.

<p>If your <a href="#black-lcd">screen turns black</a>, and you have a 
laptop, the LCD brightness may have been turned down all the way.

<p>If you're running sysinst and it says
<tt>I can not find any hard disk for use by NetBSD</tt>
then you should see the FAQ entry on <a href="#nodisk">Where's my 
disk?</a>


<ENTRY>macos-newbie Help, I don't know anything about MacOS!
This may or may not be a problem depending on your 
<a href="models.html">model</a>. Some older models require nvram patches before
they can boot NetBSD/macppc.  Often, the easiest way to add these patches is
by using a MacOS utility.  If you don't know the basics (such as to use
StuffIt Expander to extract a BinHex file, how to start a MacOS app, or even
how to copy files in the MacOS Finder), you're probably better off trying to
avoid using MacOS (unless you want to learn!). 

<p>There are ways that unix-heads can set things up easily that would pain the most
experienced MacOS user.  This FAQ entry is aimed at such unix-heads, since
the INSTALL notes are aimed at people with MacOS experience and minimal unix 
background.  

<p><h3>If you have an Open Firmware 3 system</h3>
MacOS is briefly unavoidable if you want NetBSD entirely contained on one
hard drive.  You'll need to use a MacOS utility to repartition your disk,
then copy the bootloader <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> to an HFS partition.  If you're
willing to compromise a bit, you can permanently keep <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> on
a netboot server, an ISO 9660 CD-R, or an MS-DOS disk (you'd set your
<tt>boot-device</tt> to the bootloader location, and your <tt>boot-file</tt>
to the path to your kernel).  See info on <a href="#ofw-variables">the Open
Firmware variables of interest</a>. 

<p><h3>If you have an earlier, Open Firmware 1.0.5, 2.0.x, or 2.4 system</h3>
Things get a little more interesting here, since many of these models default
to using a <a href="#ofw-input-output-devices">serial console</a>.  The quick
easy way to determine your model's default console type is to power on the
machine, and during the chime, hold down the four <tt>Command-Option-O-F</tt>
keys until the screen turns black, grey, or white.  Black means either bad
hardware or a serial console.  Grey means that you didn't successfully enter
Open Firmware and it's trying to boot MacOS.  White (with text) means the
default is a local console. 

<p>Once you've got the <tt>0&nbsp;&gt;</tt> Open Firmware prompt on your
screen or serial console, you can try installing NetBSD starting at the
"Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Without using MacOS)" section in the
INSTALL notes.  If your system can't boot NetBSD, then post to <a
href="mailto:port-macppc@netbsd.org">port-macppc@netbsd.org</a> asking
someone to mail you the nvram patches for your model.  You can use your
serial console to paste the nvram patches into Open Firmware.  See the <a
href="nvedit.html">NetBSD/macppc nvedit HOW-TO</a> for help with this step.
Once you do this, you should be golden. 

<p>Good luck!



<ENTRY>disk-sharing How do I share files between the OSes on my machine?
Unfortunately, NetBSD doesn't yet support the Macintosh file systems natively
(i.e. HFS, HFS+, and UFS), so we must use a workaround.  Install
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/sysutils/hfsutils/README.html">hfstools</a>
and/or 
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/sysutils/hfsutils/README.html">xhfs</a>
from the NetBSD package 
collection.  These utilities allow you to read and write files to an HFS
(<i>not</i> HFS+ or UFS) file system using command line tools or a graphical
browser.  If this is too much trouble for you, keep reading.

<p>Create an MS-DOS format partition.  Classic MacOS will automatically 
mount it, and the unix-like OSes (NetBSD, linuxppc, Darwin, and MacOS X) can 
mount it using the <tt>mount_msdos</tt> command.  The steps below outline
the most straightforward technique.

<p><ol>
<li>Partition your hard drive from within MacOS using Drive Setup.  <i>This 
will erase all information on your hard drive.</i>

<p><li>Next, grab a copy of 
<a href="http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/NewSearch?key=disk+charmer&amp;search=&amp;sp=sp">
Disk Charmer</a> or
<a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=1253">DiskCharmer</a>,
 and set it up to create an
MS-DOS file system.  Your settings should look something like this:
<p>
<img src="../../images/ports/macppc/diskcharmer.gif" width="405" height="251"
alt="screenshot of DiskCharmer">

<p><li>Drag the partition onto DiskCharmer's window and it will prompt you
before erasing it and creating an MS-DOS file system in place of the HFS 
file system you created in the first step.

<p><li>Now, when you boot Classic MacOS, this partition will automatically 
mount using PC Exchange or File Exchange (depending on what it's called in your 
version of MacOS).  

<p>When you boot into MacOS X, linuxppc, or NetBSD, run the following command:
<pre>mkdir -p /msdos.filesystem;/sbin/mount_msdos -m 777 /dev/disk0s11 /msdos.filesystem</pre>

where <tt>/msdos.filesystem</tt> is the mount point you'd like, and 
<tt>/dev/disk0s11</tt> is the device name for your partition.  Alternatively,
for NetBSD and linuxppc, you can add an entry to your <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>
to always mount this filesystem.  There's probably a way to do this with MacOS
X, but I don't know how yet.
</ol>

<ENTRY>partitions I'm confused by all these contradicting partition notations
And you have a right to be.  We get confused too.

<p>There are <i>three</i> partition identification schemes you'll run across
when using NetBSD/macppc.  To make things more confusing, the order of
the partitions gets shuffled around, and some have more than others.  Most of
the users with Open Firmware 1.0.5, 1.1.22, or 2.0.x models need not be
concerned with these issues, since NetBSD insists on writing its own
partition map over the contents of your drive, and that's the only partitioning
scheme you will encounter.  This section is primarily to describe the
situation on Open Firmware 3 systems.

<p>See also the <a href="partitioning.html">NetBSD/macppc Partitioning 
HOW-TO</a>

<p><ol>
<li><b>MacOS-visible partitions (by partition name in Finder):</b><br>
While you may have created a bunch of partitions in Drive Setup, only
those partitions visible to MacOS will show up in the Finder.

<p>The only partitions visible to MacOS 9 and earlier are those formatted in
HFS, HFS+, or MS-DOS formats.  The only partitions visible to MacOS X and later
are those formatted in HFS, HFS+, and UFS (<i>not</i> NetBSD's 4.2BSD FFS).
The user can manually mount MS-DOS format partitions as well.

<li><b>Open Firmware's scheme (0 thru max partition number, as seen by
  Open Firmware, also visible using pdisk):</b><br>
Additionally, these are the partition numbers used by MacOS X and Darwin.
The order of partitions is directly related to the order you selected 
in Drive Setup or the NetBSD partitioning tools.
<p><table border=1 cellpadding=5>
 <tr><td>0</td>
 <td>a special "partition" reserved for a first stage bootloader</td></tr>
 <tr><td>1 thru ~8</td>
 <td>often reserved for MacOS drivers if the drive is formatted with a MacOS
  tool, not visible from MacOS</td></tr>
 <tr><td>~9 thru ~15</td>
 <td>user created partitions, placed in order of their physical location on
  disk (i.e. HFS, A/UX, and UFS partitions are in whatever order the user
  created them in).</td></tr>
 </table>

<p><li><b>NetBSD-visible partitions (letters a thru h, as seen by 
 <tt>disklabel</tt>):</b><br>
NetBSD shuffles the partitions around such that things work out better for 
itself.  The <tt>fstype</tt> reported by <tt>disklabel(8)</tt> is set
by the Apple Partition Map flags, and does not depend on the actual
type of filesystem on that partition (be it NetBSD FFS, Apple HFS, or MS-DOS).
In particular, MS-DOS formatted partitions show up as <tt>HFS</tt> partitions.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=5>
 <tr><td>a</td>
 <td>Your "A/UX Root" partition, regardless of its order on the disk</td></tr>
 <tr><td>b</td>
 <td>Your "A/UX Swap" partition, regardless of its order on the disk</td></tr>
 <tr><td>c</td>
 <td>This is the entire disk (first sector to last sector)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>d-f</td>
 <td>First few non-A/UX partitions (usually the user HFS(+) partitions)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>g</td>
 <td>Your "A/UX User" partition (if present), regardless of its order on the disk</td></tr>
 <tr><td>h</td>
 <td>Additional non-A/UX partitions (usually user HFS(+) partitions)</td></tr>
</table>
</ol>

<p>So, for example the following is what Drive Setup created on my PowerBook 
(FireWire):
<p><table border=1 cellpadding=5>

  <td><b>Comment</b></td><td><b>Apple Partition Map type</b></td>

<p>After installation, one of the HFS partitions, "Untitled" (which is
partition 9 to Open Firmware, and partition d to NetBSD) has 
<tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt>, and one of the A/UX partitions (which is partition 12
to Open Firmware, and partition a to NetBSD) has my NetBSD kernel, so I use 
the following command to boot:
<pre>boot hd:9,ofwboot.xcf hd:12</pre>

<ENTRY>scroll-speed Why does the screen scroll text so slowly?
The text console code is not optimized in the GENERIC kernel.  There is
accelerated text console code in -current, if you build a new
kernel.  This fix is <em>not</em> in NetBSD 1.5.x.
<p>
You will need to build a new kernel.  Add the following line to your 
<a href="../../Documentation/kernel/#how_to_build_a_kernel">
kernel configuration</a>:
<pre>options	OFB_ENABLE_CACHE</pre>

<ENTRY>usb-mouse-bug My USB mouse is not recognized.

Try plugging it into the back of the Mac instead of into the keyboard.


<ENTRY>usb-keyboard-problems USB keyboard problems
There are two different types of USB keyboard problems.  One set of
problems appeared after NetBSD 1.4.3 was released, and applies only to
some iMac (Bondi Blue) and some PowerMacintosh G3 (Blue and White) machines.  
This problem has not been fixed yet.
<p>
The other problem occurred on all models with USB keyboards, but was fixed
prior to the release of NetBSD 1.5.

<p><H3>iMac (Bondi Blue) and PowerMacintosh G3 (Blue and
White) problems:</h3>
See Bob Nestor's 
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2001/06/11/0009.html">post</a>
to the mailing list describing the problem and a
workaround for the PowerMacintosh G3 (Blue and White).  This
workaround doesn't work for the iMac (Bondi Blue), but Rob Gridley reports that 
unplugging the mouse allows his system to boot and use the keyboard.  Also, 
see the problem report, 
<a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=12894">port-macppc/12894</a>
<p>
Briefly, what he recommends is:
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Unplug the USB keyboard and plug in an ADB keyboard and mouse
    <p>
  <li>Boot NetBSD with the ADB keyboard
    <p>
  <li>Enter root, swap and filesystem responses on the ADB keyboard
    <p>
  <li>When the system gets to the shell prompt (or login if you went 
    multi-user), unplug the ADB and plug in the USB keyboard
</ol>
<p>

The USB will be usable at this point and you can use the
system.  You'll notice that the ADB is dead even before you unplugged it.  
Also you <b>MUST</b> boot without the USB installed or this won't work.
<p>
Alternatively, NetBSD 1.4.3 works fine on these two models and does not
have this USB keyboard problem.

<p><h3>Repeating keypress problems prior to NetBSD 1.5:</h3>
There is a problem in some kernels that causes the first keypress
from a USB keyboard to be repeated over and over again. A symptom
of this would be the install system continually asking "<tt>(I)nstall,
(S)hell or (H)alt ?</tt>" To avoid this problem, press the
shift key before anything else.
<p>
On some newer machines, NetBSD will hang after configuring the devices but
before entering single-user mode.  The recommended solution is to unplug
all USB devices (especially hubs) and plug the mouse into the keyboard and
the keyboard directly into the back of the mac.

<ENTRY>cannot-allocate-vm-panic <tt>panic: startup: cannot allocate VM for buffers</tt>
This problem should have been fixed in NetBSD 1.5.  If you
still have this problem after upgrading, post to 
<a href="mailto:port-macppc@netbsd.org">port-macppc@netbsd.org</a>. 

<p>
On some machines with large quantities of RAM the kernel will run out of
kernel VM when it tries to allocate the buffer cache.
You can avoid this by either of:
<ol>
<li>Removing some RAM
<li>Adding <tt>"options BUFPAGES=800"</tt> to the <a
    href="../../Documentation/kernel/#how_to_build_a_kernel">kernel
    configuration</a>
</ol>

<ENTRY>wdc-lost-interrupt <tt>wdc0:0:1: lost interrupt</tt>
This problem is present in NetBSD 1.5.2 on newer machines that support 
ATA4 drives.  Unfortunately, there is presently no easy workaround.  Post 
to <a href="mailto:port-macppc@netbsd.org">port-macppc@netbsd.org</a> for 
assistance.

<p>This has been reported on the iBook (Dual USB) and the iMac (Summer 
2000) which has been updated to BootROM 4.1.9.

<p>The problem is not present in NetBSD-current.

<ENTRY>pciide-lost-interrupt <tt>pciide0:0:0: lost interrupt</tt>
This problem is fixed in NetBSD 1.5.1 and later.
If you still have this problem after upgrading, post to 
<a href="mailto:port-macppc@netbsd.org">port-macppc@netbsd.org</a>.

<p>
The NetBSD initialization code for the CMD 646 IDE controller doesn't
correctly undo some of the settings that Open Firmware sets.  What happens
is that Open Firmware sets the IDE controller up in 0646U2 mode and
changes some of the interrupt settings.  The MI pciide driver doesn't know
how to deal with this situation and you get a lot of "lost
interrupt" messages.
<p>
What this means is that if you use Open Firmware to load the bootloader
(i.e. <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt>) or the kernel from your hard drive, NetBSD
cannot use that drive.
<p>
A workaround is to place the kernel on another bootable
bus and then use that to mount the drive with your NetBSD filesystem 
on the drive connected to the CMD 646 IDE bus.  The
key phrase here is "another bootable bus".  On the G3 and G4 machines which
have this problem, they have more than one IDE bus (in addition to add-on
SCSI busses).  The hard drive is typically on the bus which we have
troubles with, but the CD-ROM and Zip drive are typically on a different
IDE bus which works just fine.
<p>
What you may want to do is move your hard drive to the bus the CD-ROM is
attached to (paying attention to the master/slave jumpers), and all your
problems will go away, although your drive is using a slower IDE bus
protocol.


<ENTRY>mesh-fifo <tt>Panic: mesh: FIFO != 0</tt>
This bug is not present in NetBSD 1.5 and later.
<p>
This is usually caused by bad SCSI cabling or devices.  Check your
internal and external termination.  Check the length and quality of your
cables.  Disconnect all devices that are not critical.
<p>
More often than not, this is caused by having a Zip drive on your MESH
SCSI bus, as these devices do not behave like good SCSI citizens.
<p>
One person
suggested that the MESH driver is more reliable if you don't reboot
from MacOS into NetBSD. (That is, if you're running MacOS, shut down
rather than rebooting, and then power it back on and boot to NetBSD.)
<p>
M L Riechers posted a very thorough 
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2000/08/02/0029.html">
message</a> on this topic.
<p>
Good luck.


<ENTRY>bm0-device-timeouts I'm getting device timeouts on bm0
This problem has been fixed in NetBSD 1.5 and later.
<p>
Inserting a 10Mb Hub (forcing bm0 to 10Mb/s instead of 100Mb/s) seems
to prevent this problem.


<ENTRY>ethernet-bad-date Ethernet isn't working
Aside from the usual sorts of problems (such as cables and 
<a href="../../Documentation/network/">configuration</a>),
NetBSD/macppc seems to have a problem using network interfaces if the date 
stored in the PRAM is too old (such as if your system has lost power or 
gotten reset in such a way that the date is set to 1904 or 1956).  The symptom
is that <tt>ifconfig</tt> doesn't complain, but no packets are sent or received.
<pre>% <b>ping 10.0.1.1</b>
PING 10.0.1.1 (10.0.1.1): 56 data bytes
<b>^C</b>

0 packets transmitted, 0 packets received,</pre>

The solution is to use <tt>date(1)</tt> to set the time correctly.

<ENTRY>power-off Woah, my machine just powered off!

Well, that's probably because you're using a recent laptop (iBook,
PowerBook (FireWire), or PowerBook G4 (Titanium)).
<p>
The page up key sequence (<tt>FN-uparrow</tt>) will panic a NetBSD 1.5.x
kernel.  This is fixed in NetBSD-current.  If you're prone to pressing
page up, you should compile a new kernel.
<p>
The "brightness" keys (F1 and F2) will power off your machine and zap your 
clock.  You will need to build a new kernel without the <tt>abtn</tt> option.
Remove the following line from your 
<a href="../../Documentation/kernel/#how_to_build_a_kernel">
kernel configuration</a>:

<pre>#abtn*  at adb?</pre>

<ENTRY>power-manager My PowerBook or iBook won't power on, charge the battery, or recognize the charger
Your power manager memory might be corrupted.
<p>
See <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=14449">TIL 14449</a>
for info on how to reset it.

<ENTRY>timedrift My PowerComputing clone's clock drifts too much.
Yeah, it appears that the <tt>timebase</tt> in Open Firmware doesn't match
the hardware.  You need to correct it.

<p>See the 
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2001/08/03/0003.html">post</a>
by Adam Lebsack.

<ENTRY>dash-a Why does the kernel always prompt me for the root device?
Various people have reported that they can't get their NetBSD/macppc
systems to boot unattended.  What happens is that Open Firmware loads the
kernel just fine, but the kernel can't seem to find the root device
(i.e. where the / filesystem is located).

<p>At the prompt, type in the device name for your root disk (usually
something like <tt>sd0a</tt> or <tt>wd0a</tt>), swap (usually something
like <tt>sd0b</tt> or <tt>wd0b</tt>), and filesystem type (usually
<tt>ffs</tt>, <tt>nfs</tt>, or <tt>cd9660</tt>). 

<p>
Until this situation is fixed, there is a workaround.  You need to 
<a href="../../Documentation/kernel/#how_to_build_a_kernel">
build a kernel</a> with the following setting:
<pre>#config		netbsd	root on ? type ? #to automatically detect root device
config		netbsd	root on sd0 type ffs #for SCSI disk
#config		netbsd	root on wd0 type ffs #for IDE disk
#config		netbsd	root on ? type nfs #for netboot
</pre>

where <tt>sd0</tt> is the name of the device with your root filesystem.

<SECTION>Supported Hardware

<ENTRY>supported-models NetBSD/macppc supported models
See the <a href="models.html">NetBSD/macppc supported models list</a>.  Also, 
see the list of <a href="#peripherals">supported peripherals</a>.

<ENTRY>nubus Are NuBus-based Power Macs supported (7100, 8100, etc)?

No. NetBSD/macppc doesn't support NuBus. In addition,the NuBus-based
Power Macs don't have Open Firmware, which NetBSD/macppc depends on
heavily for bootstrapping and console operations.

<p>
There are four groups of NuBus based Power Macintosh machines:
<ul>
<li><b>Apple PDM</b><br>
    Any x1xx machine, e.g. 6100, 6150, 7100, 8100
<li><b>Apple PERFORMA class</b><br>
    52xx, 53xx, 62xx, 63xx (except 6360)
<li><b>Apple POWERBOOK (or 'M2') class</b><br>
    1400, 2300, 5300
<li><b>Power Computing "Power" series</b><br>
    Such as the "Power 100" and "Power 120"
</ul>

<p> These systems won't work even if you upgrade the processor to a
G3, because the remaining hardware is still unsupported. (But if you
get a complete logic board upgrade, they will work, because they then
essentially become a new machine)

<p> At the current time, we don't know of anyone working on supporting
these systems. If you are interested in trying to get one of them
working, <a href="mailto:port-macppc@NetBSD.org">let us know</a>!

<p>We already have support for the 603 microprocessor, and the RS/6000 porting
effort is working on the 601 microprocessor support.  We have support
for the motherboard chipsets in <a href="../mac68k/">NetBSD/mac68k</a>.  
It's just a matter of sharing these drivers and figuring out a bootloader
that's compatible with the Open Firmware method of booting the currently
supported macppc models.


<ENTRY>68k-upgrade Are 68k-based Macs with PowerPC processor upgrades supported?

No, for the same reasons as above. (This applies only to
<em>processor</em> upgrades. If you upgrade the whole motherboard, it
essentially becomes a new machine, in which case it may be supported.)


<ENTRY>601 Are the Power Macintosh 7200 or 7500 supported?  (601 processor)

These machines have PCI and Open Firmware, but use the PowerPC 601
processor, which is not currently supported. However, the 7500's
processor is upgradable, so if you buy a 603/604/G3/G4 upgrade for it,
NetBSD will work.  See 
<a href="#cpu-upgrade">Are PowerPC CPU upgrades supported?</a>.

<p> In addition, some work is in progress on a RS/6000 port, and it
will bring 601 support to NetBSD.  Once this is done, it will be a
matter of sharing this code between rs6000 and macppc.

<ENTRY>powerbook Are PowerPC-based PowerBooks supported?

Some of them.  See the <a href="models.html">NetBSD/macppc supported
models list</a>. 

<p>The PowerBook 1400, 2300, and 5300 are not supported,
because they do not have Open Firmware.

<p>Some of the most recent models (iBook. iBook SE, iBook (Dual USB), PowerBook 
(FireWire), and PowerBook G4 (Titanium)) have keyboards that were first 
supported in NetBSD 1.5.1.  Versions of NetBSD prior to this required a 
kernel patch.

<p> Note that power management is not yet supported, so it is not
possible to suspend and resume a PowerBook while running NetBSD.

<p>See also <a href="#power-off">Woah, my machine just powered off!</a>,
<a href="#power-manager">My PowerBook or iBook won't power on, charge the 
battery, or recognize the charger</a>, and <a href="#pb418">PowerBook 
(FireWire), PowerBook G4 (Titanium), and BootROM 4.1.8</a>.

<ENTRY>cpu-upgrade Are PowerPC CPU upgrades supported?
Sure!
<p>
Many people upgrade their slow 601, 603, 604, or G3 CPUs with a faster 604, G3, 
or G4 CPU.  Actually, it's currently necessary if you have a PowerMacintosh 
7500 with the original PowerPC 601 chip.
<p>
People have reported success with upgrading the CPU in 
original PCI PowerMacintosh systems (7300 - 9600), supported PowerBooks, and
earlier G3 systems.  The common manufacturers are Newer Technology, 
Powerlogix, Sonnet, and XLR8.  If the CPU works in MacOS, it should work in
NetBSD.  

<p>Some users have reported that their system won't boot NetBSD if a new CPU
is installed into the early PCI PowerMacintosh systems (7300 - 9600).  If you
find that this is the case (i.e. you downgrade to a 604 and NetBSD works), then
you may need to boot MacOS once to install the <tt>nvramrc</tt> patches for your
CPU daughtercard.  From this point on, you should <i>not</i> use System Disk,
as it will install its own <tt>nvramrc</tt>, overwriting your CPU manufacturer's
<tt>nvramrc</tt>.  Use <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/macppc/macos-utils/bootvars/">Boot
Variables</a> instead.  This will mean that your monitor 
<a href="#non-sync-monitor">may not sync</a> if you are using the built-in 
<tt>/chaos/control</tt> in PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 models.

<p>Other models will not need the MacOS "virtual firmware" type
of patch -- NetBSD initializes the CPU just fine.

<p>Unfortunately, the Metabox Jocard G4 has some problems.  See Thomas Michael 
Wanka's
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2001/09/01/0002.html">post</a> 
on this topic.

<p>For some combinations of CPU upgrade in a particular model, you may
need to compile a special kernel to enable the L2 cache on G3 or G4 CPUs
in older systems.  Usually this is not necessary, and it "just works". 
When it doesn't, you'll see a message like the following: 
<pre>cpu0 at mainbus0: L2 cache not enabled</pre>

<p>If, when you boot, there is a message like this, 
then you should follow the directions in this

<ENTRY>badserial I'm having troubles using my serial port!
That's because the built-in serial ports don't work very well.  Actually, 
they're really only good enough for console use (and even then, they're
sometimes flaky).
<p>
Until someone fixes this, don't assume you can run a modem, ppp, sync your 
palm, or whatever.  If you have any experience with serial drivers and a 
willingness to help, please contact 
<a href="mailto:port-macppc@netbsd.org">port-macppc@netbsd.org</a>.

<ENTRY>pppmacppc How do I get ppp working?
Ouch.  Unfortunately, since the built-in serial ports don't work, there
are a few bugs in the ppp drivers that haven't been quashed.

<p>See Donald Lee's 
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2001/07/26/0023.html">post</a>
on how he got his Cyclades PCI card to run ppp.

<ENTRY>airport How do I use my AirPort or AirMac network?
You will need to 
<a href="../../Documentation/kernel/#how_to_build_a_kernel">build a
kernel</a> from -current sources, with the <tt>wi(4)</tt> driver.  NetBSD 1.5.x
does not support wireless networking.
<p>
Briefly, what you need to do is set up your wireless card to use DHCP to find
its IP address, and set up the
correct media type (typically <tt>DS11</tt>), and the correct network
(with the <tt>nwid</tt> parameter).  For example, to connect to my 
closed AirPort Base Station, I have the following in <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>:
<pre>ifconfig_wi0="nwid Gizmonet media DS11"
dhclient=YES
dhclient_flags="wi0"</pre>

<p>Each time I reboot, the AirPort card looks for a base station serving
the <tt>Gizmonet</tt> and asks it for an IP address.

You can find more information in <tt>ifconfig(8)</tt>, <tt>wiconfig(8)</tt>,
<tt>wi(4)</tt>, and <tt>ifmedia(4)</tt>.  Additionally, see
the <a href="../../Documentation/network/wavelan.html">Using
WaveLAN IEEE under NetBSD</a> page.
<p>
If your AirPort base station was set up under MacOS and you use encryption, 
you may need to run the <tt>AirPort Admin Utility</tt>, configure your 
base station, and find the equivalent network password.


<!-- ======================================== -->
<SECTION>Open Firmware

<ENTRY>ofw What is Open Firmware, and why do I care?

Briefly, it is a command environment using the FORTH language which the
NetBSD kernel uses to gether information about your system, and to control
some of your devices. It is part of the boot ROMs in most PowerPC-based
Macintosh systems, and we use it to load the kernel from disk or network.

<p>Open Firmware, as specified by "IEEE Std 1275-1994: IEEE Standard
for Boot Firmware (Initialization Configuration) Firmware: Core
Requirements and Practices" and its supplements, is a
platform-independent boot firmware. It is based on Sun's OpenBoot
firmware, and uses ANS Forth as a processor-independent interface
language.

<p>You can find more about Open Firmware at the <a
href="http://playground.sun.com/1275/home.html">Open Firmware Working
Group home page</a> or at the
<a href="http://bananajr6000.apple.com">Apple Computer Open Firmware Home 
Page</a>.

<ENTRY>ofw-version Which version of Open Firmware does my machine have?

Look at the <a href="models.html">Model Support</a> page.  If your machine
isn't listed, you can find out from within Open Firmware.  From the Open 
Firmware prompt (see <a href="#ofw-access">How do I get to the Open Firmware
prompt?</a> and <a href="#ofw-use">What can I do at the Open Firmware 
prompt?</a>), type:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dev /openprom</b>
0 &gt; <b>.properties</b>
name                    openprom
device_type             BootROM
model                   OpenFirmware 3
relative-addressing     
supports-bootinfo       

 ok</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, any machine which did not ship with a G3 or G4 processor is
either Open Firmware 1.0.5 or 2.0.x.  All desktop models without an internal 
floppy drive have Open Firmware 3.  All laptop models without built-in SCSI
have Open Firmware 3.

<p><i>Note:</i> Open Firmware 3 systems have a rewritable "firmware", also
called the <em>BootROM</em>. When you use an Apple firmware updater, it
updates the BootROM. This will <b>not</b> change the version of Open
Firmware in your machine - it will still be Open Firmware 3. The BootROM
is what is first executed when you power on or reset your system. The
BootROM then loads Open Firmware, which boots your operating system.
<p>
This BootROM 
version can be found using Apple System Profiler in MacOS.  Often, it is 
listed on the first line of your screen when you first boot into Open 
Firmware.  For example, my PowerBook (FireWire) prints:

<p><pre>Apple PowerBook3,1 2.1f1 BootROM built on 01/29/00 at 22:38:07
Copyright 1994-2000 Apple Computer, Inc.
All Rights Reserved

Welcome to Open Firmware.
[...]</pre>

<p>indicating that the BootROM version is 2.1f1.

<ENTRY>ofw-bugs Are there bugs in my machine's Open Firmware implementation?

Probably.  The
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.2/macppc/INSTALL.html">
NetBSD/macppc 1.5.2 Install Notes</a>
describe how to patch or upgrade your Open Firmware to work around these
bugs.  See the section on "Updating your BootROM" for Open Firmware 3 systems,
and the section "Older Open Firmware System Preparation" for systems with
Open Firmware 1.0.5, 2.0.x, and 2.4.

<ENTRY>ofw-access How do I get to the Open Firmware prompt?

Read the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.2/macppc/INSTALL.html">NetBSD 
1.5.2 install notes</a>.  In particular, scroll down to the section on
"Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt" for your particular version of Open 
Firmware.

<p>For the lazy, you can use Apple's <tt>System Disk</tt> to set your
machine to always boot into Open Firmware.  See the brief <a
href="SystemDisk-tutorial/">tutorial</a> on how to do this.

<ENTRY>ofw-boot-serial I tried to get into Open Firmware, but it just stopped booting, and my monitor isn't showing anything.

You didn't read the
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.2/macppc/INSTALL.html">NetBSD 
1.5.2 install notes</a>.  In particular, scroll down to the section on
"Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Older Models".  It's a bit lengthy, 
but very clear in describing the proper steps to set up Open Firmware.

<p>Briefly, all Open Firmware 1.0.5 and most Open Firmware 2.0.x systems
will default to using the `Modem' serial port for the console instead of
the ADB keyboard and the monitor attached to the on-board video. Unless
you use a MacOS-based utility to set these variables correctly, you
<i>will</i> need to hook up a serial console temporarily to set them
before you can use your keyboard and screen. 

<p>If you think you have set your system up correctly using 
<a href="SystemDisk-tutorial">System Disk</a> and you're using a PowerMacintosh
7300 - 8600 model, then you may need to apply the additional patches
for your <tt>/chaos/control</tt> on-board video to 
<a href="#non-sync-monitor">sync properly</a>.

<p>If you're using a Performa 5500 or 6500, you may need to apply some NVRAMRC
patches to use your on-board video.  See the 
<a href="models.html#5500">footnote</a> on that model.

<p>See also <a href="#ofw-input-output-devices">How do I figure out my 
<tt>input-device</tt> and <tt>output-device</tt>?</a>

<ENTRY>ofw-boot-video How do I use a PCI video card?
This section describes how to tell Open Firmware to use your PCI-based
video card, whether you purchased it separately from your computer, or it
came with it. Some models of Macintosh and some clones shipped without an
on-board video interface (see the <a href="models.html#no.fb">NetBSD/macppc
Model Support</a> page for more info). These models shipped with a
video card in one of the PCI slots. 

<p>In all cases, your video card must have Open Firmware support on it.

<p>Open Firmware uses a different device path depending on the model of the 
card and the PCI slot it is located in.  You will need to figure out
what the path is to your video card, and how to tell Open Firmware to use it.

 <p><li><pre>0 &gt; <b>dev / ls</b></pre>
  This will list all of the devices present in your system.  Look for something
  matching your video card.  For example, part of the listing from a 
  PowerMacintosh 9500/150 is:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dev /</b>
0 &gt; <b>ls</b>
  [...]
FF8313F0: /bandit@F4000000
  [...]
FF83F8A0:   /ATY,mach64@D
  [...]
 ok</pre>
Typically, if a card has Open Firmware 
support, it will list a four character vendor ID similar to the vendor's name
(such as <tt>ATY</tt> for ATI, <tt>IMS</tt> for IMS, and <tt>ADPT</tt> for 
Adaptec), and a string describing the model of the card.  The "@" sign
separates the card name from its address in the computer.

<p>Now, note that the <tt>/ATY,mach64@D</tt> entry is indented below the
<tt>/bandit@F4000000</tt> entry.  This means that the <tt>bandit</tt>
device contains the <tt>ATY</tt> device.  In this case,
<tt>/bandit@F4000000</tt> is Open Firmware's name for the PCI bus, and the
ATI card is located on the PCI bus. 

<p><li>Therefore, <tt>/bandit@F4000000/ATY,mach64@D</tt> is this card's path 
in the Open Firmware device tree.  Now, to confirm if it
really supports Open Firmware, type the following:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dev /bandit@F4000000/ATY,mach64@D</b>
0 &gt; <b>words</b></pre>
If the word "<tt>open</tt>" is among those listed, then chances are very high
that your card should work.

<p><li>Now, you'd want to type the following 
to set up a Mach64 card to be the Open Firmware output device in your system:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>setenv output-device /bandit@F4000000/ATY,mach64@D</b>
0 &gt; <b>reset-all</b></pre>

</ol>

<p>If the monitor attached to your video card stays black after the computer
resets, then there was a problem (possibly you mistyped the path to the card
or the card doesn't really support Open Firmware).


<ENTRY>non-sync-monitor My monitor doesn't always sync when I enter Open Firmware
This is a problem with the PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 machines, 
wherein the video signals do not settle quickly enough.  You should apply the 
<a href="SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch.html">patches</a> for Open Firmware 
1.0.5.

<p>
If you have a Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, there is no known
solution.  See 
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2001/04/26/0008.html">this
post</a> describing the issues.
At this time, no one has reported a successful install onto a
TAM, although, this should be possible by setting the input and output
devices to <tt>ttya</tt> with 
<a href="SystemDisk-tutorial/">System Disk</a> and connecting a serial
cable to another machine running a terminal emulator.

<ENTRY>ofw-load-base What's the deal with the "load-base" setting?

The Open Firmware environment variable <tt>load-base</tt> is the address
at which Open Firmware loads the bootloader from your <tt>boot-device</tt>.
The behavior is different for the various versions of Open Firmware and
<tt>boot-device</tt>s.  The symptom of an incorrectly set <tt>load-base</tt>
is <tt><a href="#ofw-claim-failed">CLAIM failed</a></tt>.

<p><h3>Open Firmware 3</h3>
<b>Do not change the <tt>load-base</tt></b>.
Open Firmware 3 machines have re-writable firmware, and users have found
that changing the <tt>load-base</tt> has overwritten their flash BootROM,
rendering their machines dead (requiring an expensive trip back to
Apple).  <b>Do not change the <tt>load-base</tt> on an Open Firmware 3
machine.</b>  Apple has fixed Open Firmware 3 such that you needn't change
<tt>load-base</tt> to boot.

<p><h3>Open Firmware 1.0.5, 1.1.22, 2.0.x, and 2.4</h3>
The default value of <tt>load-base</tt> on these systems is 4000, which isn't
very good for our purposes.  <a href="SystemDisk-tutorial">System Disk</a>
sets <tt>load-base</tt> to 600000, which suits us just fine.  mkLinux uses
a different value, which may prevent you from booting NetBSD/macppc.

<p>The <tt>load-base</tt> is handled differently by <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> (the
XCOFF bootloader used on MS-DOS floppies, ISO CD-Rs, and with netbooting) and 
<tt>ofwboot</tt> (the "partition zero" bootloader on the install floppies, 
install CD-R images, and hard drives prepared with <tt>sysinst</tt> or
<tt>installboot</tt>).

<p>Both <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> and <tt>ofwboot</tt> have an address stored
in their headers which is used to determine where they should be loaded in
memory.  Unfortunately, these versions of Open Firmware don't work as you'd
expect.  You must set <tt>load-base</tt> to a <i>different</i> address than
the address stored in the header of <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt>.  You <i>must</i>
set <tt>load-base</tt> to the <i>same</i> address stored in the header of
<tt>ofwboot</tt>.

<p><tt>ofwboot</tt> has been set to use 600000.  Therefore,
you should use a <tt>load-base</tt> of 600000.

<p>The NetBSD 1.5.3 <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> has been set to use 640000.  Therefore,
you should use a <tt>load-base</tt> of 600000.

<p>The <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> from NetBSD versions prior to 1.5.3 had been
set to use 600000.  Therefore, if you're trying to boot using this bootloader,
you should use a <tt>load-base</tt> of 640000
or get a newer version of <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt>

<p>Once you are entirely positive that your machine has Open Firmware
1.0.5, 1.1.22, 2.0.x, or 2.4 (see <a href="#ofw-version">Which version of
Open Firmware does my machine have?</a>), run the following commands to
set your <tt>load-base</tt> properly

<pre>0 &gt; <b>setenv load-base 600000</b>
0 &gt; <b>reset-all</b></pre>

You should double-check that this value has been set using the
<tt>printenv</tt> command.


<ENTRY>ofw-real-base What's the deal with the "real-base" setting?
The Open Firmware environment variable <tt>real-base</tt> is the address
at which <tt>ofwboot</tt> or <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> loads the kernel into memory.  
Many users have
reported that the default value of <tt>real-base</tt> causes problems that
manifest themselves as strange SCSI problems, or <tt>ofwboot</tt> hanging
while loading a large kernel (typically over 3 MB in size).
Makoto Fujiwara
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2000/08/13/0004.html">
reports</a> that changing the <tt>real-base</tt> will fix this problem.
<p>
Open Firmware 3 machines have re-writable firmware, and users have found
that changing the <tt>real-base</tt> will overwrite their firmware,
rendering their machines dead (requiring an expensive trip back to
Apple).  <b>Do not change the <tt>real-base</tt> on an Open Firmware 3
machine</b>.  Open Firmware 3 does a much better job of 
dealing with large kernels, so this is not really an issue.
<p>
Once you are entirely positive that your machine has Open Firmware 1.0.5,
2.0.x, or 2.4 (see <a href="#ofw-version">Which version of Open Firmware does 
my machine have?</a>), run the following commands
to set your <tt>real-base</tt> properly (note, System Disk will <b>not</b>
set this variable properly -- you will need to re-set your
<tt>real-base</tt> after each use of System Disk):
<pre>0 &gt; <b>setenv real-base F00000</b>
0 &gt; <b>reset-all</b></pre>
<p>
You should double-check that this value has been set using the
<tt>printenv</tt> command.
<p>
A workaround for this problem is that you can build a kernel that is less
than 3 MB in size.  Since none of the Open Firmware 1.0.5, 2.0.x, or 2.4 models 
have built-in USB, you can 
<a href="../../Documentation/kernel/#how_to_build_a_kernel">build a kernel</a>
without any USB drivers (unless you have a PCI USB card).


<ENTRY>ofw-input-output-devices How do I figure out my <tt>input-device</tt> and <tt>output-device</tt>?

This depends entirely on what devices you want use to interact with Open 
Firmware (and thus NetBSD/macppc), as well as the version of Open Firmware
you are using and the hardware you are using.

<p>Once you figure this out, you will need to set these values and store them.
See <a href="#ofw-access">How do I get to the Open Firmware
prompt?</a> and <a href="#ofw-use">What can I do at the Open Firmware  
prompt?</a>) for help getting started in Open Firmware.
Briefly, you'll want to run the following three commands (where
<i>in-device</i> and <i>out-device</i> are what you chose to use):
<pre>0 &gt; <b>setenv input-device </b><i>in-device</i>
0 &gt; <b>setenv output-device </b><i>out-device</i>
0 &gt; <b>reset-all</b></pre>

<p><h3>Open Firmware 1.0.5, 2.0.x, or 2.4 using a keyboard and monitor 
(or built-in LCD)</h3>
By default, most of these models default to a serial console (which is why
many novice users find that when they boot into Open Firmware, their
monitor stays black).  Additionally, some of these 
<a href="models.html#no.ofw.fb">models</a> have troubles 
using the on-board video device in Open Firmware (and in NetBSD/macppc).  For
these troublesome systems, your only options are a PCI video card or
a serial console.

<p>Go to the <a href="models.html">NetBSD/macppc Model Support Page</a>
and look up your model.  It should list an <tt>output-device</tt> for
your system.  If there is no <tt>output-device</tt> listed, then you should
use <tt>screen</tt>.

<p>See also <a href="#ofw-boot-video">How do I use a PCI video card?</a>
for suggestions on figuring out your <tt>output-device</tt>.

<p>For all these systems, the <tt>input-device</tt> for an ADB or built-in 
keyboard is <tt>kbd</tt>.

<p><h3>Open Firmware 3 using a keyboard and monitor (or built-in LCD)</h3>
By default, all of these systems default to using the USB or built-in keyboard
and the on-board video or built-in LCD.  You shouldn't have to do anything.

<p>See also <a href="#ofw-boot-video">How do I use a PCI video card?</a>
for suggestions on figuring out your <tt>output-device</tt>.

<p>The default values are <tt>input-device</tt> is <tt>keyboard</tt> 
(using the built-in or USB keyboard), and <tt>output-device</tt> is 
<tt>screen</tt> (using the built-in LCD, screen, or on-board video interface).


<p><h3><a name="serial-console">Open Firmware 1.0.5, 2.0.x, or 2.4 using a 
serial console</a></h3>
Open Firmware calls your computer's "modem" serial port <tt>ttya</tt>, and its 
"printer" serial port <tt>ttyb</tt>.  Some systems have an internal modem 
(such as the Performa 54xx, 6360, 6400, and 6500) that 
blocks off the built-in serial port.  You will need to set and use your 
printer port <tt>ttyb</tt> for serial console on these models.

<p>On almost all of these machines, the default values for both 
<tt>input-device</tt> and <tt>output-device</tt> is <tt>ttya</tt>, which is 
why many novice users find that when they boot into Open Firmware, their
monitor stays black.

<p>Your serial console settings should be 38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1
stop bit, no flow control, and you can typically use a standard Mac
"printer" cable to connect two Macs (even m68k-based Macs).  See the
<a href="../../Documentation/Hardware/Misc/serial.html">NetBSD Serial 
Port Primer</a> for additional help.

<p><h3>Open Firmware 3 using a serial console</h3>
None of the Open Firmware 3 models ship with serial ports.  Most do, however
have internal modems.  You can purchase a third party device which replaces
the internal modem on most desktop systems with a serial port (such as the Gee 
Three Stealth Serial Port and Griffin Technology gPort).  If you purchase one 
of these, you can set it up to be a serial console.  Set <tt>scca</tt> for both 
your <tt>input-device</tt> and <tt>output-device</tt>.

<p>Your serial console settings should be 57600 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1
stop bit, no flow control, and you can typically use a standard Mac
"printer" cable to connect two Macs (even m68k-based Macs).  See the
<a href="../../Documentation/Hardware/Misc/serial.html">NetBSD Serial 
Port Primer</a> for additional help.


<ENTRY>ofw-dir-listing How do I get a listing (in Open Firmware) of the files on my disk?
With the <tt>dir</tt> command, of course!

<p>The syntax is simply
<tt>dir&nbsp;<i>device</i>:<i>[partition]</i>,\</tt> where <i>device</i>
is the <tt>devalias</tt> or full path to the device you're trying to get a
listing of and <i>[partition]</i> is the partition number to get the
listing of.  If you do not specify the partition number, Open Firmware
will try to find the first partition it understands.  The comma separates
the device and partition from the directory or files. 

<p>Open Firmware uses backslash characters to separate directories, and
you must specify the top level of a device with an "<tt>\</tt>".  You can also
get directory listings of individual files or files in folders using backslash
characters to separate directories.

<p>Keep in mind that the Open Firmware <tt>dir</tt> command can only list 
the contents of file systems that Open Firmware understands.  For Open Firmware 
1.0.5, 1.1.22, and 2.0.x, you can use ISO 9660 (<i>not hybrid</i>) and 
MS-DOS.  For Open Firmware 2.4, you can use ISO 9660, HFS, HFS+, and 
MS-DOS.  For Open Firmware 3, you can use hybrid ISO 9660/HFS (<i>not</i>
pure ISO 9660), HFS, HFS+, and MS-DOS.

<p>For example,
to get a listing of the files on a floppy, type:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dir fd:,\</b></pre>

To get a listing of the files on a CD-ROM, type (for example):
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dir scsi-int/sd@3:,\</b></pre>

To get a listing of the files in the macppc folder on an HFS partition, type:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dir hd:9,\macppc\</b></pre>

To get your client's dhcp or bootp information from ethernet, type:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dir enet:</b></pre>



<SECTION>Booting

<ENTRY>boot-support What are the supported ways of booting NetBSD/macppc?

See the
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.2/macppc/INSTALL.html">
NetBSD/macppc 1.5.2 Install Notes</a> and read the section entitled
"Available Boot Media".

<ENTRY>boot-disk How do I make a disk bootable, and what are the Open Firmware commands to boot from it?

This depends entirely on what version of Open Firmware your machine has,
and what you're trying to boot from. Read the "Preparing the Bootable
Media" and "Open Firmware boot syntax" sections of the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.2/macppc/INSTALL.html">

<tt>installboot(8)</tt> man page


<ENTRY>boot-pci How do I boot from a device attached to a PCI card?
Your PCI card must have Open Firmware drivers.  Very few do.
Many Adaptec SCSI cards and some IDE/ATA cards have Open Firmware drivers.
Asante made some ethernet cards with Open Firmware drivers (though no one
has tested them).  Cards manufactured for UltraSparc systems often have
Open Firmware drivers.  Not much else does.

<p>Just because a card works in Open Firmware does not mean it's supported by 
NetBSD (and vice versa).  This is the case with some of the MacOS IDE/ATA cards.

<p>The first step is to figure out what the PCI card is called in terms of
Open Firmware names.  Apple created <tt>devalias</tt> shortcuts for the
on-board devices (such as scsi, hd, and enet).  PCI card manufacturers
cannot do this.  Open Firmware uses a different device path depending on
the model of the card and the PCI slot it is located in. You will need to
figure out what the path is to your PCI card, and how to tell Open
Firmware to use it.

  that might match your PCI card.  For example, part of the listing from a 
  PowerMacintosh G3 (Blue and White) with an Adaptec 2930 SCSI interface is:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dev /</b>
0 &gt; <b>ls</b>
  [...]
FF8313F0: /pci@F2000000
  [...]
FF83F8A0:   /pci-bridge@D
  [...]
FF83F90D:     /ADPT,2930@3
 ok</pre>
Typically, if a card has Open Firmware 
support, it will list a four character vendor ID similar to the vendor's name
(such as <tt>ATY</tt> for ATI, <tt>IMS</tt> for IMS, and <tt>ADPT</tt> for 
Adaptec), and a string describing the model of the card.  The "@" sign
separates the card name from its address in the computer.

<p>Now, note that the <tt>/ADPT,2930@3</tt> entry is indented below the
<tt>/pci-bridge@D</tt> entry, which is indented below the 
<tt>/pci@F2000000</tt> entry.  This means that the <tt>pci</tt>
device contains the <tt>pci-bridge</tt> device which contains the 
<tt>ADPT,2930</tt> device.

<p><li>Therefore, <tt>/pci/pci-bridge@D/ADPT,2930@3</tt> is this card's path 
in the Open Firmware device tree.  Now, to confirm if it
really supports Open Firmware, type the following:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dev /pci/pci-bridge@D/ADPT,2930@3</b>
0 &gt; <b>words</b></pre>
If the word "<tt>open</tt>" is among those listed, then chances are very high
that your card should work.

<p><li>If you're extra lucky, the <tt>show-children</tt> word is listed.
Otherwise, you'll need to know the SCSI ID of the drive you
are trying to boot from.  The SCSI ID gets appended to the path of your device
with an <tt>/@N</tt> (where <tt>N</tt> is the SCSI ID).

<p><li>Next you need to figure out what boot method you're using so you can
specify the partition number and the bootloader filename.  Typically, 
Open Firmware 1.0.5, 2.0.x, and 2.4 systems use a "partition zero" bootloader, 
and thus <tt>:0</tt> is appended to the path.  Open Firmware 3 systems
load <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> from an HFS partition (usually 9 or higher), so
you'd append something like <tt>:9,\ofwboot.xcf</tt> to the path.

<p><li>Now, you'd want to type the following to set up a hard drive with
<tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> on the 9th partition of a SCSI ID 5 drive attached to
an Adaptec 2930 card to be the Open Firmware <tt>boot-device</tt> in your
PowerMacintosh G3 (Blue and White): 

<pre>0 &gt; <b>setenv boot-device /pci/pci-bridge@D/ADPT,2930@3/@5:9,\ofwboot.xcf</b>
0 &gt; <b>reset-all</b></pre>

<p>Some Beige G3 models shipped with an Apple 53c875 Ultra Wide SCSI host 
adapter.  To boot from the drive at SCSI ID 0, you would set your 
<tt>boot-device</tt> to:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>setenv boot-device /pci/Apple53C875Card/sd@0:0</b>
0 &gt; <b>reset-all</b></pre>

</ol>

<p><i>Note about the Adaptec 2940 series of SCSI cards</i>.  There are
three versions of the Firmware for this series of SCSI cards.  If you are
using this card on a PowerMacintosh 7300 thru 9600, then you cannot use
the card to boot from Open Firmware.  See 
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2001/04/27/0000.html">this
post</a> which has more information.

<ENTRY>boot-net How do I set up netbooting?

See the <a
href="../../Documentation/network/netboot/">Diskless NetBSD
HOW-TO</a>.

<p>Mitchell Spector has also created a page containing a concise <a
href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/tech/netbsd_imac.shtml">iMac-specific
netbooting information</a>.


<ENTRY>cdr-image Where is the official NetBSD/macppc CD-R image stored?
<p>Look for the <a href="../../mirrors/#iso">NetBSD Download Site</a>
closest to you, download the image, and burn it to a CD-R.

<p>See the section titled <a name="cdr151">"Boot off the
NetBSD/macppc CD-R image"</a> in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.5.2/macppc/INSTALL.html">
NetBSD/macppc 1.5.2 Install Notes</a>.

<a href="#nodisk">Where's my disk? (a.k.a. sysinst says <tt>I can not find any 
hard disk for use by NetBSD</tt>)</a>. 


<ENTRY>bootx Can I use the Linux BootX utility to boot NetBSD/macppc?
No, although the BootX maintainer has said he will accept patches for
NetBSD support if someone else writes them. (See the <a
href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/1999/03/12/0002.html">port-macppc
mail archives</a>.)
<p>
Note, this is entirely different than the Darwin BootX bootloader.

<ENTRY>bootx-darwin Can I use the Darwin/MacOS X BootX bootloader to boot NetBSD/macppc?
No, although it should be easier to port to NetBSD/macppc than the linuxppc
BootX, since the Darwin BootX uses Open Firmware.

<p>
See <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2000/12/12/0003.html">
this post</a> for instructions on getting the BootX source code if you're
interested in working on this.

<p>
This repository also contains nvram patches for machines with Open
Firmware 2.4 and earlier, based on the patches in System Disk.


<ENTRY>ofw-boot-keys Are there any other magic keys to change the boot sequence?

Besides the familiar Command-Option-P-R to reset the PRAM (which will
erase your Open Firmware settings), and the
slightly-less-familiar Command-Option-Shift-Delete to boot from the
first bootable device other than the normal boot device, on some
machines you can also hold down "C" to boot off the internal CD-ROM
drive, "N" to net boot, "Z" to boot from an internal Zip drive, or "D"
for force booting from the internal disk if the default boot device
has been set to something else. (These are referred to as "snag keys"
in Apple's literature.)

<p>These actually use the "cd", "enet", "zip", and "hd" devaliases in
Open Firmware, respectively, so changing the aliases will change the
effects of these keys. Some models do not support all of the keys.

<ENTRY>netboot-probs Common netboot problems
<ul>
<p><li><pre>0 &gt; <b>boot enet:,\ofwboot.xcf </b>BOOTP failed
 can't OPEN enet:
 ok</pre>
Bootp or DHCP server isn't responding to client's request.  Check that the 
server is running, that it's on the same ethernet subnet, and that it has 
the correct ethernet hardware (MAC) address for the client.  Look for
<tt>local-mac-address</tt> in the output of:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>dev enet</b>
0 &gt; <b>.properties</b></pre>

<p><li><pre>TFTP timeout</pre>
Either the server's TFTP server isn't running, or you're using a model with
Open Firmware 1.0.5 and not specifying the location of the bootloader.
Unfortunately, on the early models, <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> gets confused and
doesn't work right unless you load it explicitly from the <tt>boot-device</tt>,
even if the bootp or DHCP server provides the correct information.
You need to boot with a command like:
<pre>0 &gt; <b>boot enet:,\ofwboot.xcf</b></pre>

<p><li><pre>enet:,/netbsd.ram.gz: Inappropriate file type or format</pre>
Older PowerMacintosh systems with Open Firmware 1.0.5 booting over ethernet
with <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> version 1.2 or earlier can't load compressed
kernels.  Use <tt>gunzip(1)</tt> to uncompress it.
</ul>

<ENTRY>ofw-claim-failed <tt>CLAIM failed</tt>

This is a general message from Open Firmware to the effect that it failed
to allocate some memory or memory is messed up.

<p>First, make sure you have <a href="#ofw-load-base"><tt>load-base</tt></a>
set correctly.

<p>If you tried one boot command and it failed, then you tried a second
and got the <tt>CLAIM failed</tt> message, then this is an indication that you
should reboot between attempts (the Open Firmware command is "reset-all"). 

<p>Contradictorily, if your machine is Open Firmware version 1.0.5, 2.0.x
or 2.4, this error does sometimes appear randomly.  You might try the boot
command a second time (this is known to work on some models). 

<p>There are several <a href="models.html#no.ofw.fb">models</a> that cannot be 
booted while using the on-board video and keyboard.  Try using
a <a href="#serial-console">serial console</a>.

<ENTRY>default-catch <tt>DEFAULT CATCH!</tt>
This is a general message from Open Firmware to the effect that it had trouble
loading a file.

<p>If your machine is Open Firmware version 1.0.5 or 2.X, this error does
sometimes appear randomly.  You might try the boot command a second time
(this is known to work on some models).  It's also an indication that
either your floppy disk is bad, or the floppy drive is bad.  Try doing a 
low-level format on the floppy, re-copy the files, and try again.

<p>There are several <a href="models.html#no.ofw.fb">models</a> that cannot be 
booted while using the on-board video and keyboard.  Try using
a <a href="#serial-console">serial console</a>.

<ENTRY>cant-open <tt>can't OPEN</tt>
Open Firmware either can't open the device you specified (because it is not
present or the device path is mistyped) or the file you specified. Check
your typing and check to make sure that the media has the files you think
it has. 

<p>Use the <a href="#ofw-dir-listing"><tt>dir</tt></a> command to get a listing 
of the files. 

<ENTRY>formatstate-not-valid <tt>unrecognized Client Program formatstate not valid</tt>
This is a general Open Firmware error message indicating that the filename
you tried to open either doesn't exist or is in the wrong format. For
Open Firmware 1 and 2 machines, it must be an XCOFF file (such as
<tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt>)
and for Open Firmware 3 machines, it must be either XCOFF or ELF (such as
a kernel).

<ENTRY>bad-partition <tt>bad partition number, using 0no bootable HFS partition</tt>
You tried booting an Open Firmware 1.x or 2.0.x machine from a device
which has an HFS filesystem on it (such as a hybrid CD-R or a hard drive
with MacOS partitions). 

<ENTRY>drive-spinup My hard drive doesn't spin up before Open Firmware tried booting
To add a delay before trying to boot (to allow a hard drive to spin up),
put the <a href="SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch2.txt">following
patch</a> in your nvramrc:

<pre>: wBoot
begin
 boot-device ['] $boot catch drop
 ." -Waiting for boot-device" cr
 d# 500 ms
key? until
;</pre>

Then you need to run <tt>nvstore</tt>.  See the 
<a href="nvedit.html">NetBSD/macppc nvedit HOW-TO</a> for more help patching
your nvramrc.  Now, you need to specify that your
boot command is different, so at the Open Firmware prompt, type:<br>

<tt>0 &gt; <b>setenv boot-command wBoot</b></tt>
<p>

Alternatively, you can just patch the boot-command:<br>

<tt>0 &gt; <b>boot-command begin ['] boot catch 999 ms cr again</b></tt>
<p>
There are reports that this single-line alternative doesn't work on some
early Open Firmware 1.0.5 models.


<ENTRY>pb418 PowerBook (FireWire), PowerBook G4 (Titanium), and BootROM 4.1.8
The two models listed above will fail to boot NetBSD 1.5.x and earlier if 
they have have <a href="#ofw-version">BootROM</a> version 4.1.8 or later.
<p>
Unfortunately, you will either need to 
<a href="../../Documentation/kernel/#how_to_build_a_kernel">build a new 
kernel</a> from -current to boot
NetBSD on these models, or send your machine back to Apple to be flashed to an
earlier BootROM version.


<ENTRY>grey-screen Why does the screen turn grey with an icon in the center?
This means that your system is trying to boot MacOS.  You might get to this state
if you didn't properly <a href="#ofw-access">enter Open Firmware</a>, or if
your Open Firmware boot command is misformed.

<p>If you typed a bad <tt>boot</tt> command, Open Firmware tries to boot
from the <tt>boot-device</tt> variable, whose default value is the MacOS ROM.
See info on <a href="#ofw-variables">The Open Firmware variables of 
interest</a> for help here.

<p>The grey screen with the icon is generated by the MacOS ROM.  A
flashing question-mark or broken folder means that your machine is looking
for a bootable MacOS filesystem, but can't find one.  A happy face means
it's trying to boot MacOS. 

<p>The boot floppy does not have a bootable MacOS filesystem, it has a
bootable NetBSD filesystem. 

<p>Reboot, re-enter Open Firmware and check your syntax carefully.


<ENTRY>black-lcd Why did my screen turn black during boot?
This is a bug.  The NetBSD kernel has turned off your backlight.  Turn up
the brightness on your PowerBook screen to fix this.
<p>
If you don't have a PowerBook, then see
<a href="#ofw-boot-serial">I tried to get into Open Firmware, but it just 
stopped booting, and my monitor isn't showing anything</a>.


<ENTRY>nodisk Where's my disk? (a.k.a. sysinst says <tt>I can not find any hard disk for use by NetBSD</tt>)
Well, that's a good question!

<p>The root cause is that NetBSD didn't find your hard drive (or, more 
insidiously, didn't find your drive controller).  There a variety of reasons
why this happens.  First determine whether it found your IDE controller 
(in the boot messages that scroll by, you should see a line with <tt>wdc0</tt>
(for IDE) or <tt>scsibus0</tt> (for SCSI)).  If not, then you'll just have
to use a different kernel that supports your drive bus.  Post to
<a href="mailto:port-macppc@netbsd.org">port-macppc@netbsd.org</a> for help.

<p>Now, eliminate the easy problems (drive plugged in, powered on, and
has jumpers set correctly).  Check that the drive works under MacOS.

<p>If NetBSD still can't find the disk, then for SCSI disks, check the 
termination.  Even though MacOS can use it, NetBSD may be pickier about the
timings on the SCSI bus.

<p>If you have a recent machine which support ATA4, and/or you've 
installed a recent FirmWare update (late 2001), and you're trying to use 
NetBSD 1.5.2, you may run into the 
<a href="#wdc-lost-interrupt"><tt>wdc0:0:1: lost interrupt</tt></a> problem.

<p>If you've got an IDE drive, then you may have a PowerMacintosh
G3 (Blue and White) or an earlier system.  It wasn't until after the B&amp;W
system that Apple fully worked out all the kinks with IDE devices.  Many
people report that they have to put their NetBSD drive on the alternate
IDE bus, and/or make it master (setting the CD-ROM to be slave).

<p>To make the matters worse, the NetBSD 1.5.1 install kernel image does
not support the IDE controller in the PowerMacintosh G3 (Blue and White).  The
real kernel does support it.

<p>Unfortunately, you may need to play around a bit to find the right
combination that works for all the OSes you use on your system.  Keep in
mind that any system that does not have Open Firmware 3 cannot boot from
slave devices (an Open Firmware limitation).

<p>Chris Tribo has posted a good breakdown of the early G3 models and their 
limitations/identification.  See his 
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2001/07/26/0019.html">post</a>.
Also see the Apple  
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=24342">Power Macintosh 
G3 and G4: IDE Master and Slave Support and Configuration</a> article
on this topic.


<!-- ======================================== -->
<SECTION>Misc

<ENTRY>elf Where is <tt>ldconfig</tt>/<tt>ld.so.conf</tt>?

NetBSD/macppc uses ELF, so it does not have <tt>ldconfig</tt> or
<tt>ld.so.conf</tt>. See the <a
href="../../Documentation/elf.html">NetBSD ELF FAQ</a> for more
details.


<ENTRY>cross-compile How can I cross-compile from another NetBSD architecture?

First, build and install the cross/powerpc-netbsd package in the
packages collection.

To build a kernel, configure it as you normally would, and then build
it with:

<pre>
	make PATH=/usr/pkg/cross/powerpc-netbsd/bin:$PATH \ 
		MACHINE=macppc MACHINE_ARCH=powerpc depend all
</pre>

Cross-compiling userland is slightly more complicated. (XXX finish)

(XXX this should move to an MI FAQ)


<ENTRY>linux Can NetBSD/macppc run MkLinux or LinuxPPC binaries?
Yes. Linux binary compatibility for PowerPC ports is supported in 
NetBSD-current. Applications that are reported to work include 
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/www/communicator/README.html">
Netscape Communicator</a>, 
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/lang/blackdown-jdk13/README.html">Blackdown's JDK-1.3.0</a>, and 
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/graphics/blender/README.html">Blender</a>.
All theses programs are included
in the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/software/packages.html">
NetBSD package collection</a>
<p>
Binaries that have known problem are: 
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/www/opera/README.html">Opera</a>, 
which will crash on first startup. On the second startup, if you go to the 
advanced settings dialog and uncheck "asynchronous DNS", it should work 
without troubles. The other troublesome application is RealPlayer, which
is just unusable, due to a machine independent bug in Linux kernel threads 
emulation 
(<a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=10101">PR 
#10101</a>).
<p>
It is probably worth mentioning that the JDK works quite
well. Java applications such as 
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/www/cocoon/README.html">Cocoon</a>
have been reported to work without any problem.
<p>
Also note that Linux binary compatibility is <i>not</i> included in NetBSD 
1.5.x.  You will need to run a <tt>-current</tt> kernel or wait for a future 
release of NetBSD.


<ENTRY>macos Can NetBSD/macppc run MacOS binaries?
Well, some day someone might get <a
href="http://www.ibrium.se/linux/mac_on_linux.html">Mac-on-linux</a>
(for LinuxPPC) to work.  Meanwhile, try
<a href="http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/B2Main.html">Basilisk II</a>
or <a href="http://www.vmac.org">VMac</a>
both of which emulate a 68k Mac.


<ENTRY>macosx Can NetBSD/macppc run Darwin/MacOS X binaries?
No, although theoretically it should be possible.  The Darwin binaries are in
<tt>Mach-O</tt> format, which is a rarity, as most unix-like OSes use 
<tt>a.out</tt>, <tt>ELF</tt>, or <tt>XCOFF</tt> binaries. 

<ENTRY>keys What do the <img src="../../images/ports/macppc/icon-command.gif" width="13" height="13" alt="command key"> and <img src="../../images/ports/macppc/icon-option.gif" width="17" height="13" alt="option key"> icons mean

Apple has some unusual keys on its keyboards that may confuse some people
(particularly with non-US keyboards).  The key with the
<img src="../../images/ports/macppc/icon-command.gif" width="13" height="13"
alt="command key"> symbol on it is commonly
referred to as the "Command" key.  Some keyboards also have an "open apple"
(<img src="../../images/ports/macppc/icon-open-apple.gif" width="13" height="15"
alt="open apple key">) on the
command key as well.  On non-US keyboards, the key with the
<img src="../../images/ports/macppc/icon-option.gif" width="17" height="13"
alt="option key"> symbol on
it is labeled as the "option" key on US keyboards.
<p>
Often, when you read Mac documentation, you'll see the instruction to hold
down "C-O-p-r" or some other variation.  This means you should hold down
the command and option keys in addition to the letters "p" and "r". 

<ENTRY>german-kbd-at Where's the "at" (@) key on a German ADB keyboard?
Under MacOS, it is Shift-Alt-1, and in Open Firmware, it is Shift-Alt-2.

<ENTRY>adb-short How do I boot my system without an ADB keyboard?
If you're using a serial console, don't have an ADB keyboard, and don't
want to reach behind (or wherever) your real power switch is located, you
can create a hardware hack that appears to the computer to be the
"power" key on an ADB keyboard.  All Macs have a real power switch (be it
soft or hard power), it may just be a bit hidden.  This will void your
warrantee, don't hold us liable, etc.  See Chris Tribo's 
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2001/06/09/0002.html">post</a>
to the mailing list on this topic.
