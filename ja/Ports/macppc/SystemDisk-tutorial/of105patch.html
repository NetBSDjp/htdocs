<h1>NetBSD/macppc Open Firmware 1.0.5 Patch</h1>

<hr>
<p>

This is describes how to patch Apple's System Disk utility to fix a few
minor problems on Open Firmware 1.0.5 machines that use 
<tt><font color="green">output-device</font> /chaos/control</tt>
(i.e. PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600).  It is based
on a <a href="http://lppcfom.sourceforge.net/fom-serve/cache/378.html">
post</a> by one of the Copland developers, and a <a
href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2000/03/21/0002.html">post</a>
by Monroe Williams to the port-macppc mailing list.
<p>
The instructions herein are aimed at someone with a minimal knowledge of
MacOS.  If you are more comfortable with serial terminals and emacs than 
MacOS, see <a href="../faq.html#macos-newbie">Help, I don't know anything 
about MacOS!</a>.


<ol>
  <li><big><b>Boot into MacOS</b></big>
      <p>
      You must be running MacOS 8.0 or higher.
      <p>
      If you don't have MacOS 8.0 or higher, you can simply download the 
      <a href="http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/System/Mac_OS_8.1_Update/Disk_Tools_PPC.img.bin">Disk
      Tools PPC.img</a> from Apple's site.  This is a MacOS 8.1 boot
      floppy.  You can boot from this and swap floppies to get System Disk, or
      you can copy the files from this floppy onto a partition on your hard
      drive.  You will need to use 
      <a href="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n60353">Disk Copy 6.3.3</a>
      or later to write the Disk Tools image to a floppy (you can use 
      any MacOS 7.0.1 or later system, including pre-PowerPC (i.e. m68k) Macs).
      You cannot, however, simply dump the boot floppy image to a disk via 
      <tt>dd(8)</tt> or <tt>rawrite</tt>.
      <p>
      Note, for future reference, that any time you boot your machine into
      MacOS, all Open Firmware settings (including the nvram) will be set to
      their default values.
      <p>

  <li><big><b>Download</b></big>
      <p>
      <a href="ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/macosxserver/utilities/SystemDisk2.3.1.smi.bin">ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/macosxserver/utilities/SystemDisk2.3.1.smi.bin</a>
      <p>
      You may need to use StuffIt Expander (or some other utility) to
      convert that file from MacBinary format into the self-mounting disk image.
      See <a href="http://www.stuffit.com/expander/notes.html">Aladdin Systems'
      help page</a>.
      <p>

  <li><big><b>Mount the Self-Mounting Image</b></big>
      <p>
      Open the self-mounting image to mount it on your
      desktop, and locate the <tt>System Disk</tt> utility on the disk image.
      <p>

  <li><big><b>NVRAM Patches (Easy Method)</b></big>
      <p>
      If you're using System Disk 2.3.1, download this ResCompare 
      <a href="systemdisk-of105-patch.hqx">System Disk 2.3.1 OF105
      patch.hqx</a>.  This program will patch your System Disk to add some
      delays to let the video settle properly and always sync up at 680x480 at
      60 Hz (this is apparently the only resolution Open Firmware supports
      on these machines).
      <p>

  <li><big><b>NVRAM Patches (Guru Method)</b></big>
      <p>
      Download <a
      href="http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/Utilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.sea.bin">http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintos

h/Utilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.sea.bin</a>
      and extract ResEdit.  Drag the System Disk application onto ResEdit
      and (if you've got System Disk 2.3.1) open <tt>OFpt</tt> resource ID 128.
      If you have a different version of System Disk, then you need to open
      the <tt>OFtc</tt>
      resource and determine which ID corresponds to your model of
      PowerMacintosh.
      <p>
      Once you've found the correct <tt>OFpt</tt> resource, paste the
      <a href="of105patch.txt">following</a> at the end of the big long
      string.  Be sure to include a trailing carraige return or else System
      Disk will complain that the last line ends abruptly.  Also, note the
      initial <tt>\</tt>, which belongs on the end of the
      last line of Apple's patches (<tt>unselect-dev</tt>)
      <p>
      <pre>        \
        dev /bandit/gc/via-cuda\
        ' write value &amp;W\
        : -&amp;We &amp;W swap - execute ;\
        : P1 4D8 -&amp;We false 548 -&amp;We ;\
        &amp;W FC + ' P1 BLpatch\
        : P2 0C 2 ms ;\
        &amp;W E0 + ' P2 BLpatch device-end</pre>
      <p>
      <cite>Th[is] block fixes a bug in the via-cuda driver in which not
      enough time is given for the device to settle when it is told to set the
      video controller's clocks up.</cite>
      <p>
      The author of this patch also created a patch for machines that try to
      boot before their drives have spun up, however, it seems nvram isn't
      quite big enough to fit both of these patches in addition to the patches
      that come with System Disk.  It's not clear if this patch is really
      needed though.  So, instead of the above block, you should paste in the
      <a href="of105patch2.txt">following</a> at the end of the the big long
      string.  Be sure to include a trailing carraige return or else Startup
      Disk will complain that the last line ends abruptly.  Also, note the
      initial <tt>\</tt>, which belongs on the end of the
      last line of Apple's patches (<tt>unselect-dev</tt>)
      <p>
      <pre>        \
        : wBoot\
        begin\
         boot-device ['] $boot catch drop\
         ." -Waiting for boot-device" cr\
         d# 500 ms\
        key? until\
        ;</pre>
      <p>
      <cite>Th[is] block defines a FORTH word that can be used in place of
      the normal boot-command contents to wait for the disk to spin up before
      attempting to really boot.  This avoids the standard "black screen the
      first time you power on the computer each day" problem.</cite>
      <p>
      This means you'll need to make sure your boot command is not
      <tt>boot</tt>, but <tt>wBoot</tt> (this is set in the Advanced Options
      panel).
      <p>

  <li><big><b>Save, Run, Save</b></big>
      <p>
      Save your ResEdit changes and quit.  Now, run the modified System Disk
      program and click on <tt>Power User (Open Firmware)</tt> then click the
      <tt>Save</tt> button to write the new nvram contents.
