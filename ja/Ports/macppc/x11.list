<SECTION>General Questions

<ENTRY>which-x Which X Window System package should I use?
Xmacppc or XFree86?  There are two complete X Window System packages
available for the macppc platform.  
<p>
The <a href="#xmacppc-support">Xmacppc</a> package uses the raw
device that is set up by Open Firmware.  It is very limited in capability,
but runs on almost all supported macppc models.  It cannot change the
resolution of your screen or use more than 8 bpp color depth.  It does not
have any acceleration of any sort.
<p>
The <a href="#xfree-support">XFree86</a> package uses
its own knowledge about the video card's chipset, but there are no
drivers for the older macppc models which used Apple-developed video
chipsets (as opposed to newer systems which use video cards from ATI or
NVIDIA).  Thus, XFree86 supports a small subset of all supported macppc
models, but it is a much more capable X server -- it handles resolution
switching and more than 8 bpp color depth, in addition to some
acceleration.

<ENTRY>delete How come the delete key produces a tilde (<tt>~</tt>) instead of deleting?
Actually, it produces the proper VT100 delete key, not the delete escape
sequence (which is what just about every other VT100 emulator does).
<p>
You will need to run the following command each time you start the X
server:
<pre># <b>xmodmap -e "keycode 59 = BackSpace"</b></pre>
Of course, you can place this command into your <tt>xdm/Xsetup_0</tt> file
or in each users' <tt>.xinitrc</tt>.

<p>
To get only xterm to recognize this, insert the following line into one of
the default setting locations:
<pre>XTerm*VT100*deleteIsDEL: true</pre>

<p>
While the most universal location would be
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</tt>, this might cause problems
if you or one of your users runs an xterm on a remote X server without
the correct VT100 delete key.  Less intrusively, you could put it into
the <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> file in the home directory of each user that will
be using X from the console.

<ENTRY>root-console <tt>Cannot open kbd/mouse : no such file or directory</tt>
This happens when a non-root user tries to run <tt>startx</tt> or
<tt>xinit</tt>.  The default behavior of NetBSD/macppc is for the console
devices to belong only to root.  We suggest you run something like xdm,
which will change the permissions when a user sucessfully logs in.
<p>
Alternatively, you can use ttyaction(5) which changes the permissions when 
the user logs in.  For example, create <tt>/etc/ttyaction</tt> with the 
following contents:
<pre>console * /usr/sbin/chown ${USER} /dev/wskbd0 /dev/wsmouse0
ttyE0   * /usr/sbin/chown ${USER} /dev/wskbd0 /dev/wsmouse0</pre>


<ENTRY>mouse-buttons How can I emulate a 3-button mouse with a 1-button mouse in X?

At the moment, you can only set up keys on your keyboard to be mouse 
keys.  We suggest trying to find a cheap 3 button mouse, as most ADB
and USB mice are supported.
<p>
You will be using xmodmap(1)
to remap keys on your keyboard to mouse buttons.
Create an <tt>.xmodmaprc</tt> file in each users' home directory, and have
their <tt>.xinitrc</tt> run `<tt>xmodmap .xmodmaprc</tt>'. The contents of
the <tt>.xmodmaprc</tt> will specify which key enables/disables the keyboard
pointer buttons, and which keys correspond to which mouse buttons.  For
example, on an Apple Extended Keyboard II, I use:
<pre>keycode  79 = Pointer_EnableKeys
keycode 113 = Pointer_Button1
keycode 115 = Pointer_Button2
keycode 121 = Pointer_Button3</pre>
where keycode 79 is the `<tt>Num Lock</tt>' key (which enables/disables
mouse keys), and 113, 115, and 121 correspond to F13, F14, and F15.
<p>
On my PowerBook (FireWire), I use F8 (108) to enable and F10 (117), F11
(111), and F12 (119) for the mouse keys.
<p>
To figure out what keys correspond to which keycodes, use the 
xev(1)
command.  You may also want to put your keymap for the <a
href="#delete">delete key</a> into your <tt>.xmodmaprc</tt> as well.


<SECTION>XFree86 Questions

<ENTRY>xfree-support Which models can run XFree86?
Only models that have supported video cards with appropriate Open Firmware
initialization.  In general, this means only recent models (i.e. Open
Firmware 3) or a supported video card (such as an ATI Rage 128).
<p>
To install Xfree86, you will need to:
<ol>
<li>download the pre-compiled XFree86 distribution:<br>
  <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/macppc/X-4.2.0-current/">
  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/macppc/X-4.2.0-current/</a>
<li>remove your existing X WIndow System package in <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>
  and extract the XFree86 distribution
<li>Create an <a href="#xfconfig"><tt>/etc/X11/XF86Config</tt></a> file
  which describes your hardware and settings
<li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/index.html#how_to_build_a_kernel">
Compile and install a kernel</a> with `<tt>options INSECURE</tt>'.
</ol>

<ENTRY>xfconfig How do I create an XF86Config file?
Coming soon.

<ENTRY>insecure <tt>Fatal server error: ppcPciInit: /dev/kmem</tt>
Unfortunately, at present, the XFree86 X server requires direct access to
<tt>/dev/kmem</tt> which is typically something you only want root
programs to have access to.  By doing the following, you are opening up a
security hole (albeit a small one).
<p>
You will need to <a
href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/index.html#how_to_build_a_kernel">
compile a new kernel</a> with `<tt>options INSECURE</tt>', as
this is not enabled in the default GENERIC kernel shipped with
distributions of NetBSD.

<ENTRY>xkb My keymap is all screwed up.
You may need to create (as root) the following directory for XFree86 to store
keyboard mapping information:
<pre>mkdir -p /var/db/xkb;chmod 755 /var/db/xkb</pre>

<SECTION>Xmacppc Questions

<ENTRY>xmacppc-support Which models can run Xmacppc?
Every model that can boot with console support and models with supported
video cards (that have proper Open Firmware initialization code).  Models
which require you to use a serial console can not run any X servers.
<p>
While it supports almost every NetBSD/macppc model, the downside is that
the color depth is limited to 8 bpp, there is no way to change screen
resolution, and there is no graphics acceleration.
<p>
This is the standard X server which is distributed with NetBSD 1.5.x.

<ENTRY>changing-resolution How do I change the resolution or the number of colors?
You can't do this from within NetBSD.  These settings need to be changed
in Open Firmware.  Also, NetBSD/macppc does not yet support color depths
of more than 8 bpp.
<p>
Older machines (7300 - 8600) cannot change resolutions from within
Open Firmware.  They are fixed to 640x480 at 67 Hz (after applying the <a
href="SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch.html">patch</a>).  Without this
patch, the frequency is undetermined (usually 60 Hz or 120 Hz, but could  
be just about anything).
<p>
<!-- On newer machines Open Firmware &gt;= 2.0, you can type (at the Open 
Firmware prompt):
(pre)0 &gt; (b)dev screen(/b)
0 &gt; (b)show-modes(/b)
0 &gt; (b)mode#(/b)
1 &gt; (b).(/b)(/pre)
(p)
This will list the resolutions available on your system.  If you set your
system to one of these resolutions from within MacOS, then Open FIrmware
should keep that setting. -->

On newer machines, you need to set the resolution you want from within
MacOS.  Open Firmware should then keep that setting.
<p>
Chris Tribo reports that his XClaimVR 64 card ignores the MacOS monitor
setting and always comes up at the same resolution.
