<dt><b>2001-07-19:</b> SGMAP DMA improvements in NetBSD/alpha -current
    <dd>Jason Thorpe has made some improvements to the SGMAP DMA
    code in NetBSD/alpha -current.
    <p>
    For those who have more memory
    than the direct-mapped DMA window can address (this is usually
    "&gt;1G" or "&gt;2G"). then you can now use all that memory.  This
    is because Jason has implemented mbuf support in the SGMAP routines.
    Along with this, the SGMAPS routines have been made a bit more
    efficient.
    <p>
    A binary snapshot of NetBSD/alpha -current, including these
    changes, will be available shortly.

<dt><b>2001-04-20:</b> NetBSD/alpha MP goes multi-user, code in NetBSD-current
    <dd>Jason Thorpe has gotten multiprocessor NetBSD/alpha kernels
    to go multi-user, running both user and kernel code on multiple
    processors.  So far, through a kernel build and full userland
    build, it seems pretty stable.
    <p>
    All the code to make this work has been committed to NetBSD-current,
    and testing so far has been on an AlphaServer 1200.  This is the same
    systype as the AlphaServer 4100, so MP configurations of that should
    also work well.
    <p>
    <b>Systems that should work in an MP configuration:</b>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>AlphaServer 1200
      <li>AlphaServer 4100
      <li>DEC/Alpha Processor, Inc. DP264
      <li>DEC/Alpha Processor, Inc. UP2000
      <li>DEC/Alpha Processor, Inc. UP2000+
      <li>API CS20
      <li>Compaq DS20
    </ul>
    <p>
    The AlphaServer 8200/8400 won't work yet.  There are a couple fixes
    which will need to be done before the 8200 and 8400 will work in an
    MP configuration.
    <p>

    <dd>The <a href="http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/">Compaq Test Drive
    Program</a> has added <a href="../../Releases/formal-1.5/">NetBSD 1.5</a>
    to the list of operating systems available for you to try.
    The Test Drive Program is a free service of <a
    href="http://www.compaq.com/">Compaq</a>, with the main purpose of
    providing developers with access to new Compaq hardware running
    a variety of operating systems and applications.  After you
    register, you can get a free shell account which you can use to log into
    the systems on their Test Drive network and try out the software and
    operating systems running on them.  More information on what the Test
    Drive network is, and what you can do with your account, is located in
    the <a href="http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/faq/">Test Drive
    FAQ</a>.
    <p>
    <a href="../../Releases/formal-1.5/">NetBSD 1.5</a> is the latest formal
    release of NetBSD, which includes many significant new features and
    enhancements.  You can try NetBSD/alpha 1.5 running on an <a
    href="http://www.compaq.com/alphaserver/ds10l/">AlphaServer DS-10L</a>
    and see if NetBSD supports your software, or if it's something you'd
    like on your own system.

    <dd>Matthew Green has committed a tiny change to &lt;sys/lkm.h&gt;
    to fix LKM's on the NetBSD/alpha port.  To take advantage of this,
    you will need to rebuild your kernel and modload(1) with the fixed
    &lt;sys/lkm.h&gt;.  Trying to load a LKM on an old kernel will cause
    a panic, and using an old modload(1) will return ENOTTY (Inappropriate
    ioctl for device).
