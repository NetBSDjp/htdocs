 NetBSD/arm32 originally formed the basis of a project called
 <em>RiscBSD</em>. The RiscBSD group (originally Mark Brinicombe,
 Robert Black, Neil Carson, Manar Hussain, Scott Stevens,
 and Melvin Tang-Richardson) wanted to port a free unix operating
 system to Acorn's newly announced RiscPC system which was based on the ARM610
 processor. The RiscBSD project was first conceived at the launch
 of Acorn's RiscPC, due to the presence of
 <a href="http://www.xara.co.uk/">Xara's</a>
 <a href="http://www.thermal.demon.co.uk/">Gordon Taylor</a>. We went ahead,
 and after carefully studying the likes
 of Mach, Linux and FreeBSD, nominated NetBSD as our OS of choice.
 <p>
 As time drifted by, the team reduced in size with only Mark, Neil,
 Robert and Scott remaining. <a href="http://www.nc.com/">Network
 Computer</a> then funded the development of a variety of enhancements
 to the operating system and associated toolchain, for use on
 the <a href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/iag/">Digital Shark</a>
 computer.
 <p>
 These days, the NetBSD/arm32 tree is mainly written in people's spare time.
 Details of contributions and authors are listed on the port's main web page.
 At the moment, we don't know if the VLSI RC7500 port actually works. If
 there's someone out there that can help, this would be greatly appreciated.
 <p>
 These days, RiscBSD is merely a CD ROM distribution of
 NetBSD/arm32 for Acorn machines, prepared by Mark Brinicombe.
 The original RiscBSD `team' no longer exists. For more information
 on the RiscBSD distribution, look at the
 <a href="http://www.causality.com/riscbsd/">RiscBSD</a> web site.
