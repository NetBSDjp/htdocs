<h1>NetBSD/atari History</h1>

<hr>
<p>

The Atari port of NetBSD became available to the public in March 1995.
The first formal release was
<a href="../../Releases/formal-1.1/">NetBSD 1.1</a>.  The most
recent formal release is
<a href="../../Releases/formal-1.6/">NetBSD 1.6</a>.
<p>

The NetBSD/atari port started out with the NetBSD 1.0 sources. As a
basis, Leo Weppelman took the Amiga-port, since this port seemed to be
the best fit to the Atari hardware he had at that time - a TT030. This
turned out a good starting point and within a few months he had
something derived that did actually run on his TT030.
<p>

The Atari-port was announced to the NetBSD
core team in December 1994. It still took some time to get it into shape.
Finally, at the end of March 1995, the Atari port became an initial part
of NetBSD.
<p>

At that time, NetBSD/atari only ran on an TT030. It didn't take long before
requests started coming in for a Falcon port... Making the initial Falcon
port was a tedious experience for all people involved. The problem was that
Leo didn't own a Falcon and the people owning a Falcon were unable to
compile their own kernels because they were lacking a decent bootstrap
environment (a la NetBSD/atari ;-). After lots of retries, the initial
problems - most of them in the SCSI area - were solved. This took about 5
tiresome months.
<p>

Now that the basic building blocks were in place, the time left before the
first NetBSD release that included Atari support (1.1), was spent fixing
lots of bugs and smoothing sharp edges.
<p>

Somewhere in 1996, Leo bought an Hades. Hades support was added at the
end that year. The Hades architecture opened the door to various ISA and
PCI cards. NetBSD 1.3 was the first release supporting the Hades.
<p>

The latest addition to the NetBSD/Atari line is the Milan. The first, yet
still a bit experimental, support was added in NetBSD 1.6.
<p>
