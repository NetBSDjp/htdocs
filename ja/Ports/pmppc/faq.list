<SECTION>General Problems/Questions


<ENTRY>booting How do I boot NetBSD?
NetBSD is booted over the network.  You need two things, a TFTP
server to load the kernel image and an NFS server for the file
systems.
<p>
The NetBSD kernel has been relocated for loading at address 0x40000,
so the Artesyn monitor has to be set up for this load address.
Use the monitor commands <em>nvdisplay</em> and <em>nvupdate</em>
to configure the boot parameters, and <em>boottftp</em> to boot.

<ENTRY>pci Can NetBSD configure the PCI devices?
NetBSD can configure the PCI devices if the option PCI_NETBSD_CONFIGURE
is used.  This may not work if the firmware also configures
the devices.  The firmware configuration can be turned off
using <em>nvdisplay</em>.

<ENTRY>flash Can the NetBSD kernel be flashed?
Yes, the same kernel that is booted over TFTP can be flashed.
The steps are:
<ul>
<li> Get the kernel into memory:
<pre> tftp_get 40000 kernel-name</pre>
<li> Write it to flash.  The size of the kernel is reported by tftp_get.
Use it in the command to copy from RAM to flash:
<pre> flashblkwr 40000 70000000 size</pre>
<li> Use <em>nvdisplay</em> to make sure that <tt>CopyToLoadAdr</tt> is
set, that <tt>RomBase=70000000</tt>, and that <tt>RomSize</tt> is large
enough to copy the whole kernel.
</ul>
