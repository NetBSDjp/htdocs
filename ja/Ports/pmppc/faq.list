<SECTION>General Problems/Questions


<ENTRY>booting How do I boot NetBSD?
NetBSD is booted over the network.  You need two things, a TFTP
server to load the kernel image and an NFS server for the file
systems.
<p>
The NetBSD kernel has been relocated for loading at address 0x40000,
so the Artesyn monitor has to be set up for this load address.
Use the monitor commands <em>nvdisplay</em> and <em>nvupdate</em>
to configure the boot parameters, and <em>boottftp</em> to boot.

<ENTRY>pci Can NetBSD configure the PCI devices?
NetBSD can configure the PCI devices if the option PCI_NETBSD_CONFIGURE
is used.  This may not work if the firmware also configures
the devices.  The firmware configuration can be turned off
using <em>nvdisplay</em>.

<ENTRY>nfs Why doesn't NFS work?
It seems that the Ethernet chip on the PM/PPC card has trouble with
large NFS block sizes.  The solution is to mount with a smaller block
size.

<ENTRY>bugs Why do my files get corrupted?
There is a bug in the PowerPC pmap code, it seems to afflict all PPC
ports.  It causes files written from an mmap()ed file to sometimes
contain zeroes.
<p>
There is a very hacky workaround: duplicate line 413
<pre>
    memcpy(kp, p, l);
</pre>
in the file sys/arch/powerpc/powerpc/trap.c.
