<SECTION>General Questions

<ENTRY>serial_console Using a serial console
On most models, you can configure the Boot ROM to use a serial console instead
of a locally attached keyboard and the framebuffer.  The serial console will 
typically run at 9600 bps, 8 N 1 on Port "A" or "1".  The procedure varies
between models, but you <i>will</i> need a keyboard and monitor connected 
initially to configure the Boot ROM.  The procedure is described below.

<p>There are some tricks you can play to force a serial console without 
initially connecting a keyboard and monitor.  For models with removable
framebuffers (such as the 720, 730, 735, and 755), simply remove the SGC
framebuffer and the system will default to serial console.  Apparently,
<a href="http://lists.parisc-linux.org/pipermail/parisc-linux/1999-December/008119.html">powering 
up with the keyboard disconnected</a> and
<a href="http://lists.parisc-linux.org/pipermail/parisc-linux/1999-December/008138.html">holding
down the TOC (Transfer of Control) button on the side of the machine for 
10 seconds while powering up</a> will force a serial console.  The last two
tricks do not appear to work on older models (such as the 715 and 735).
See the <a href="serialconsole-712.html">special instructions</a> for model
712 workstations.

<li>Turn the PA-RISC machine on.  Have both the keyboard and mouse connected.
<li>During the boot process, the following message will appear:
<pre>
    Searching for Potential Boot Devices.
    To terminate search, press and hold the ESCAPE key.
</pre>
When this message appears, press and hold the Esc key until an options
menu appears.

<li>By default, you enter the <tt>BOOT_ADMIN</tt> console. In some 715s, 
the options menu looks like this:

<pre>
        b)    Boot from specified device
        s)    Search for bootable devices
        a)    Enter Boot Administration mode
        x)    Exit and continue boot sequence
        ?)    Help

        Select from menu:
</pre>

  Select <tt>a) Enter Boot Administration mode</tt>. This will bring up a
  <tt>BOOT_ADMIN&gt;</tt> prompt. Everything else you do will be in 
  <tt>BOOT_ADMIN</tt> mode.  So now, everybody is in the <tt>BOOT_ADMIN</tt>
  console!

<li>To change to serial console mode, type the following command at the
  <tt>BOOT_ADMIN</tt> command prompt:

<pre>
path console rs232_a.9600.8.none
</pre>

<li>Power down, power up.  Be ready to hit ESC on your terminal to break
  into the same options menu as in step 3.
</ol>

from my 735/99.


<ENTRY>boot_admin How do I configure power-on settings (boot device, console, etc.)
All 700 series workstations have a Boot Administration command line utility
in their Boot ROM which lets you configure various settings.  For example,
you can set whether the system automatically boots an OS, which device to
try booting from first, determine the ethernet MAC address, set up a serial
console, and possibly do some low level hardware access.

<p>To get to the <tt>BOOT_ADMIN</tt> prompt, you must press the <tt>ESCAPE</tt>
key before it tries to boot an OS.  Since these machines often take a long
time between powering on and the brief window of time where you can hit
the <tt>ESCAPE</tt> key, you must pay attention.  It may take over a minute
after pressing the power button before anything will show up on screen.

<p>Once you have escaped out of the <tt>Selecting a system to boot</tt>
and <tt>Searching for Potential Boot Devices</tt> you need to type the
"<tt>a</tt>" key to get to the <tt>BOOT_ADMIN</tt> prompt.  Now, use the
online help with the <tt>HELP</tt> command. 

<p>Have fun (and see this brief <a href="boot_admin.html">transcript</a> of
some of the <tt>BOOT_ADMIN</tt> menus options on a 735/99).


<ENTRY>boot_order What devices does my system try to boot from (and how do I change it)
Use the <tt>AUTOSELECT</tt> and <tt>PATH</tt> commands in the 
<a href="#boot_admin"><tt>BOOT_ADMIN</tt></a> environment.

<ENTRY>hpux_compat HP-UX Compatibility
NetBSD/hp700 will one day feature extensive binary compatibility with
HP-UX programs, however this work has not been done yet.

<ENTRY>hp700-history History of NetBSD/hp700
The hp700 port of NetBSD was started by Matt Fredette in October 2001.
He started working with Michael Shalayeff's 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/hppa.html">OpenBSD/hppa</a> sources
at that time, and after much work had it booting multiuser in March
of 2002.  At that time he began merging the port into the NetBSD tree.
