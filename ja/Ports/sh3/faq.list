<SECTION>NetBSD Questions

<ENTRY>crossbuild How can I start cross-builds?
See <a href="../../Documentation/cross/">Cross-building NetBSD</a>
for cross build in general.
<p>

<PKGSRC>cross/sh-netbsdcoff (for big endian) and
<PKGSRC>cross/shel-netbsdcoff (for little endian)
should be good starting points.
Build script is provided in 
<CURRENTSRC>sys/arch/sh3/conf/build-sh3.el and
<CURRENTSRC>sys/arch/sh3/conf/build-sh3.eb.
At least you need to update MACHINE and MACHINE_ARCH settings.

<SECTION>Hardware Questions

<ENTRY>evalcard Are there evaluation cards available outside of Japan/with non-Japanese documents?
We have <A HREF="">listed couple of eval cards</A> we know of,
if you have any additions, please submit those to the
<a href="../../MailingLists/#port-sh3">port-sh3</A> mailing list.
Unfortunately we have information for Japanese evaluation cards only.
<p>

If you are outside of Japan, the best place you could contact is
your local Hitachi office (like Hitachi US, Hitachi UK, whatever).
They should have evaluation boards to sell to customers (since they would
like to sell the SH3/4 chips), possibly with localized documents.
<p>

Among Japanese products, mmEye and Dreamcast are available outside of Japan.
