<h1>NetBSD/sparc64 History</h1>

<hr>
<p>

The NetBSD/sparc64 port began with
<a href="../../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a>
sources from around the
<a href="../../Releases/formal-1.2/">NetBSD 1.2 release</a>.
Taking the
<a href="../sparc/">NetBSD/sparc</a> as a baseline, Eduardo Horvath
modified, added or rewrote all that was necessary.
NetBSD/sparc64 had its first formal release with
<a href="../../Releases/formal-1.5/">NetBSD 1.5</a>.
<p>

The original binary and source snapshot of NetBSD/sparc64 was made
available to the public on January 15, 1999.  It supported only
the Ultra1 family of workstations, with partial support for the
Ultra2 family.  The onboard SCSI and Ethernet were not support for
the Ultra2, though Sbus SCSI cards were supported.
<p>

In early 2000, <a href="mailto:pk@NetBSD.org">Paul Kranenburg</a>
commited support for the Happy Meal Ethernet, providing onboard ethernet
for the Ultra2 port.
<p>

In mid 2000, <a href="mailto:mrg@NetBSD.org">Matthew Green</a>,
with much help from Eduardo Horvath,
commited support for the UltraSPARC IIi-based PCI-based systems
(Ultra5, Ultra10, AXi, etc.)  Some onboard devices (serial, keyboard
and mouse) were not supported until later.  Shortly afterwards
<a href="mailto:pk@NetBSD.org">Paul Kranenburg</a> commited the
final support needed for the high-end UltraSPARC PCI-based systems,
currently only tested on an Enterprise 250 system.  Many more significant
bug fixes appeared in the following months.
<p>

In October 2000, Eduardo Horvath solved the long-standing problem
with Sbus ethernet, allowing Ultra1 and Ultra2 class systems to have
usable ethernet.
<p>

2001 saw further code sharing with the SPARC port, plus many new
devices and systems supported, including the SunBlade 100, and many
(smaller) UltraSPARC server machines.
<p>

The switch to an in-tree toolchain (currently gcc 2.95.3 based, waiting
for gcc 3.3) and lots of small improvements in various areas made the sparc64
port a full-grown port as of the
<a href="../../Releases/formal-1.6/">NetBSD 1.6 release</a>.
<p>

The main missing features today are multi-processor support and X server
support for more frame buffer types, both are currently (slowly) being 
worked on.
