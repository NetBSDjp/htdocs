<h1>NetBSD/mipsco History</h1>

<hr>
<p>

In July, 2000, Wayne Knowles, a researcher in New Zealand,
successfully ported NetBSD to his RC3230 made by MIPS Computer Systems,
Inc.  The RC3230 was a R3000A desktop box commonly called R3000 Magnum;
a popular workstation that was re-badged by companies such as Bull and
Olivetti.  The port name was decided to be NetBSD/mipsco so other computers
by MIPS Computer Systems could be included in it.
<p>

In early August, NetBSD/mipsco was merged into the main NetBSD tree, and
saw many initial improvements.  Changes were committed to allow the
kernel to read either a BSD disklabel created under NetBSD/sparc or a
MIPS volume header created under Risc OS.  This change allowed the stand
alone shell to directly load a NetBSD kernel and mount a filesystem -
NetBSD/mipsco became self-sufficient.
<p>

The following persons helped greatly in the process of creating this port:
<p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Wayne Knowles:</b> port maintainer and main developer
  <li><b>Toru Nishimura:</b> developer
  <li><b>Francis Bogsanyi and Chris Collins:</b> provided feedback from the
      pre-alpha snapshot
</ul>
<p>

If you're interested in following or becoming a part of the current 
development efforts, there's a port-mipsco mailing list.  This list can be
subscribed to either on the <a href="../../MailingLists/#port-mipsco">NetBSD
mailing lists</a> page on the NetBSD web site, or by sending a mail with the
body of "subscribe port-mipsco" to majordomo@netbsd.org.  More information is
also available on the <a href="../mipsco/">NetBSD/mipsco port page</a>.
