</ul>


<SECTION>General Questions

<ENTRY>serialconsole Things worth knowing about the Indy serial console
Note this information may apply to other models too. To get the machine
boot up with a serial console, make sure the keyboard is unplugged when
turning on the machine. The serial console runs on serial #1, at 9600,
8N1 by default.
<p>

It is also possible to do a "<tt>setenv console d</tt>" in the PROM
monitor to get the console to serial #1, or a "<tt>setenv console d2</tt>"
to get it to serial #2 (default is "<tt>g</tt>"). Optionally, the console's
speed can be set with "<tt>setenv dbaud &lt;bps&gt;</tt>". After setting
these PROM variables either do an "<tt>init</tt>" or a reboot of the machine
is needed.
<p>

When booting up Irix on the console, logins on the serial console
might be disabled. You can enable them by editing /etc/inittab
and adding the following line:
<p>

<pre>
st:23:respawn:/sbin/getty systty co_9600        # serial console - HF
</pre>

Don't forget to re-read the inittab then with "<tt>init q</tt>".
<p>

The serial port pinouts are the same as SPARC systems' serial ports, so
Macintosh serial cables work great for serial-console cables, as long as
you are willing to do it without hardware handshaking lines.  See the <a
href="../../Documentation/Hardware/Misc/serial.html">NetBSD Serial Port
Primer</a> for more information. 


<ENTRY>bootstrapping How to bootstrap NetBSD/sgimips?
<ul>
<li> To bootstrap the port, you need to netboot the kernel using the SGI's
     ARCS firmware. See the <a href="../../Documentation/network/netboot/">Diskless NetBSD HOW-TO</a> for more information on 
     setting up netbooting. Some rought steps are:
     <p>

     <ol>
     <li> Unpack the etc.tgz and base.tgz e.g. in /home/indy/root.
          Run "<tt>sh MAKEDEV all</tt>" in the root/dev dir. 
     <li> Go into the machine's PROM, and retrieve the MAC
          address. Use "<tt>printenv eaddr</tt>" to do so.
     <li> Setup DHCP. Put something like this into /etc/dhcpd.conf:

<pre>
ddns-update-style       none;
subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {			# Adjust
	host indy {
		hardware ethernet 08:00:69:09:93:78;    # Adjust to your MAC address
		fixed-address 10.0.0.15;                # Adjust
		#filename "/netbsd";                    # XXX Do NOT set!
		option root-path "/home/indy/root";
		server-name="10.0.0.3";
	}
}
</pre>

     Make sure you don not set the "<tt>filename</tt>", else you
     cannot specify a different name for the kernel on the PROM's
     <tt>boot</tt> command later.
     <p>

     <li> Enter the machine's PROM again, and be sure the IP address
          is set properly:
     <p>

     <tt>
     &gt;&gt; <b>printenv netaddr</b><br>
     netaddr=1.2.3.4<br>
     &gt;&gt; <b>setenv netaddr 10.0.0.15</b><br>
     &gt;&gt; <b>printenv netaddr</b><br>
     netaddr=10.0.0.15<br>
     </tt>
     <p>

     <li> Make sure you have tftp enabled in /etc/inetd.conf, then
          drop a proper kernel into /tftpboot, e.g. netbsd.IP22.
          <p>

     <li> Tell the PROM to do a netboot, loading the "netbsd.IP22"
          kernel: 
     <p>

     <tt>
     &gt;&gt; <b>boot -f bootp():/netbsd.IP22</b><br>
     Setting $netaddr to 10.0.0.15 (from server 10.0.0.3)<br>
     Obtaining /netbsd-IP22 from server 10.0.0.3<br>
     ...<br>
     </tt>
     <p>

     <li> When asked for root device, enter "<tt>?</tt>" to get a list of
          choices. E.g. "<tt>sq0</tt>" is the Indy's ethernet.
     <li> Just press RETURN for the dump device
     <li> Unless you have prepared your disk to boot from it, your
          root filesystem will most probably be via nfs, so give that
          for root device: "<tt>nfs</tt>". 
     </ol>

     If you encounter trouble, use tcpdump(8) or pkgsrc/net/ethereal
     to debug the network traffic. See the Irix
     <a href="http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?prom">prom</a>
     manpage for more help on PROM commands.
     <p>

<li> Then prepare a second hard disk with NetBSD's FFS and
     disklabel. You then tell the kernel to use root/swap on the second
     disk. The firmware can't currently boot the kernel from an FFS
     filesystem, though, and you'll need to boot that via the net for
     now.
</ul>
<p>

To start bootstrapping, the following files are needed:
<p>

<dl compact>
<dt>Snapshot:
<dd><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/sgimips/snapshot/">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/sgimips/snapshot/</a>
<dt>Kernel:   
<dd><a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/sgimips/netbsd.ip32">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/sgimips/netbsd.ip32</a>
</dl>

<ENTRY>crosscompiling How to crosscompile a sgimips kernel?

NetBSD 1.6 and later systems have full support for cross-compilation
of the base system, even as a non-root user and even on non-NetBSD hosts.
See the <a href="../../Documentation/cross/">Cross-building NetBSD</a>
under <a href="../../Documentation/">NetBSD Documentation pages</a>
for details.

<ENTRY>resetting-eaddr How to reset $eaddr on IP22 etc.?
Here's a method to set the ethernet address that works on at
least the Indy, and perhaps also other machines with HPC3's.
<p>

All disclaimers apply yadda yadda.
<p>

At the PROM prompt:
<p>

<tt>dump -w -x 0xbfbe04e8</tt>
<p>

Sanity check the output here to see if it matches the address
given in the 'ec0: bad ethernet address' error message. If not,
you may not want to overwrite whatever is there instead.
<p>

<tt>
fill -w -v 0xGG 0xbfbe04e8
fill -w -v 0xHH 0xbfbe04ec
fill -w -v 0xII 0xbfbe04f0
fill -w -v 0xJJ 0xbfbe04f4
fill -w -v 0xKK 0xbfbe04f8
fill -w -v 0xLL 0xbfbe04fc
</tt>
<p>

Where GG:HH:II:JJ:KK:LL is the intended ethernet address. It's a
very good idea to reuse the address the machine was shipped with.
Check the back of the machine if you cannot remember it.
<p>

Power down, wait one full minute and then power up. All variables
will have been reset as with the resetenv command, except $eaddr.

<ENTRY>prom-tftp-client-failing PROM tftp client failing with default NetBSD tftpd settings

The PROM tftp client on SGI machines can fail with default NetBSD tftpd
settings.  The problem is that your current PROM may not support port
numbers with the sign bit set.  The workaround is to limit the port
numbers of anonymous connections to 32767.  The following tunables
should fix your problem:
<p>
<tt># sysctl -w net.inet.ip.anonportmin=20000<br>
# sysctl -w net.inet.ip.anonportmax=32767</tt>



<ENTRY>prom-issues Other PROM issues you might encounter

There are a few gotchas depending on your PROM version and the
OS (SASH) version installed:
<p>

<ol>
<li> Old versions of SASH have an issue with incorrectly reporting
     the memory map... If the kernel panics with a UVM related msg
     on boot (even before the copyright message), try booting the
     kernel directly from the PROM rather than via sash (An I2 also
     had this problem before upgrading to IRIX 6.x -- it was running
     5.3 before).
     <p>

<li> Another old PROM issue -- old PROMs don't understand ELF, so
     you may need an ECOFF kernel.  A workaround for this is to use
     sash, which seems to understand ELF even in IRIX 5.x, but see
     problem #1.
     <p>
</ol>
