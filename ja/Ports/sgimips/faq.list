<h1>NetBSD/sgimips Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<LIST>

<SECTION>General Questions

<ENTRY>bootstrapping How to bootstrap NetBSD/sgimips?
To bootstrap the port, you need to netboot the kernel using the SGI's
ARCS firmware, then prepare a second hard disk with NetBSD's FFS and
disklabel. You then tell the kernel to use root/swap on the second
disk. The firmware can't currently boot the kernel from an FFS
filesystem, though, and you'll need to boot that via the net for
now.
<p>

To start bootstrapping, the following files are needed:
<p>

<dl compact>
<dt>Snapshot:
<dd><a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/sgimips/snapshot/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/sgimips/snapshot/</a>
<dt>Kernel:   
<dd><a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/sgimips/netbsd.ip32">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/sgimips/netbsd.ip32</a>
</dl>

<ENTRY>resetting-eaddr How to reset $eaddr on IP22 etc.?
Here's a method to set the ethernet address that works on at
least the Indy, and perhaps also other machines with HPC3's.
<p>

All disclaimers apply yadda yadda.
<p>

At the PROM prompt:
<p>

<pre>dump -w -x 0xbfbe04e8</pre>
<p>

Sanity check the output here to see if it matches the address
given in the 'ec0: bad ethernet address' error message. If not,
you may not want to overwrite whatever is there instead.
<p>

<pre>fill -w -v 0xGG 0xbfbe04e8
fill -w -v 0xHH 0xbfbe04ec
fill -w -v 0xII 0xbfbe04f0
fill -w -v 0xJJ 0xbfbe04f4
fill -w -v 0xKK 0xbfbe04f8
fill -w -v 0xLL 0xbfbe04fc</pre>
<p>

Where GG:HH:II:JJ:KK:LL is the intended ethernet address. It's a
very good idea to reuse the address the machine was shipped with.
Check the back of the machine if you cannot remember it.
<p>

Power down, wait one full minute and then power up. All variables
will have been reset as with the resetenv command, except $eaddr.

<ENTRY>prom-tftp-client-failing PROM tftp client failing with default NetBSD tftpd settings
The PROM tftp client on SGI machines can fail with default NetBSD tftpd
settings.  The problem is that your current PROM may not support port
numbers with the sign bit set.  The workaround is to limit the port
numbers of anonymous connections to 32767.  The following tunables
should fix your problem:
<p>
<tt># sysctl -w net.inet.ip.anonportmin=20000<br>
# sysctl -w net.inet.ip.anonportmax=32767</tt>
