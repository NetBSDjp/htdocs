<h1>NetBSD/<font color="#CC0000">hpcmips</font> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

This page contains information about NetBSD/hpcmips FAQ.

<LIST>

<SECTION>Booting

<ENTRY>auto-start Is there any way to automatically start an application on a Compact Flashmedium under Windows CE?
The current status is that we have no idea, but forward to improve
suspend/resume codes.  If you have any ideas, working code is welcome.

<SECTION>PsPc Machine 

<ENTRY>input-device How does one give input to a Palm-sized PC with no keyboard?
You can connect vt100 to serial connector.

<SECTION>Others

<ENTRY>use-microdrive Can we use IBM microdrive?
Yes.  If your machine supports IBM microdrive on WinCE environment, it will
work fine.  With IBM z50, IBM microdrive and PCMCIA TypeIII hard drive is
supported, but it is heavy regarding battery life.

<ENTRY>cassiopeia-a-series Can I run NetBSD on Cassiopeia A series?
No. The Cassiopeia A series have a SH3 CPU, which is not supported by hpcmips.
No SH3 CPU Type <a href="../">NetBSD Ports</a> support Windows CE machines
right now.

<ENTRY>hpcmips-apm Does H/PC hardware has APM hardware?
There is no such thing as APM hardware.  APM is a bios spec only.
The Vr41xx CPUs support a course battery level only (very low, which 
is really good).  There's nothing like a battery percentage in the hardware,
unless it is an addon doo-dad.  

<ENTRY>z50-lcd Is a test snapshot with the IBM z50 LCD suspend available anywhere? 
In the -current sources.
If you want to use test code, recompile kernel with ITE8181_LCD_CONTROL_ENABLE.
Or change ite8181_lcd_control_disable variable to 0 by gdb.
More information,  see arch/hpcmips/dev/ite8181.c.

<ENTRY>mobilepro-usb Does USB work on the MobilePro 8xx machines?
Yes, as of NetBSD 1.6.2 and 2.0 in the GENERIC config file.  Some umass
devices have strange errors, but most devices work correctly.  Note that the
USB port on these machines can only supply a max of ~500mA, so an externally
powered USB hub is highly recommended.
