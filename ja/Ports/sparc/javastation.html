<h1>NetBSD/sparc JavaStation Support</h1>

NetBSD-current supports two JavaStation models at present,
the JavaStation-1 (a.k.a. "Mr.Coffee") and JavaStation-10 (a.k.a.
JavaStation-NC or "Krups").

<p>Unlike other non-Sun operating systems for the JavaStation, NetBSD does
<i>not</i> require you to modify the PROM or NVRAM.  It should "just
work", since the NetBSD bootloader will apply any necessary NVRAM patches
for you.

<p>Sun switched their boot ROM from using OpenBoot PROM 2 to using Open
Firmware in later JavaStation-1 machines.  All JavaStation-10 machines use
Open Firmware.  OpenBoot PROM is what the rest of the NetBSD/sparc
machines have.  Open Firmware is what is used in NetBSD/sparc64 models.

<p>Briefly, the JavaStation-1 is a stripped down SPARCstation 4 (other 
than using Open Firmware in some units).  The JavaStation-10 is an   
entirely new architecture (different bus type, framebuffer chipset, and
serial chipset).

</ul>

<h2><a name="mrcoffe">JavaStation-1 (a.k.a. "Mr.Coffee")</a></h2>

<p>The banner the JavaStation displays at boot-time indicates which boot 
ROM is present.
If it displays "<tt>OpenBoot 2.30</tt>", it has OpenBoot PROM 2.  If it
displays "<tt>OpenBoot 3.x</tt>" (where x is usually 10 or 11), it has
Open Firmware.

<p>Unfortunately, the OpenBoot PROM 2 does not properly initialize the
PS/2 style keyboard/mouse controller. This means you can't configure the
PROM without a serial console.  The NetBSD/sparc kernel for JavaStation 
models supports PS/2 
keyboards, so you can use the keyboard once the NetBSD kernel is loaded. 

<p>Open Firmware has no PS/2 keyboard/mouse issues.

<p>The Xsun X11R6 server works with the PS/2 keyboard and mouse
(kernel patches not committed).

<p>Audio playback and recording work.

<p>OpenBoot PROM 2-based JavaStation-1 units will netboot like any other
NetBSD/sparc machine.  See the 
<a href="../../Documentation/network/netboot/intro.sun.html">sparc-specific
section</a> of the Diskless NetBSD HOW-TO. 

<p>Open Firmware-based JavaStation-1 units will netboot like any other
modern machine -- they send a DHCP request for a TFTP server and
bootloader filename, then download and execute that file.  These units
require a different bootloader than other NetBSD/sparc machines.  Make
sure you use <tt>bootjs.elf</tt> from the snapshot or distribution.  See the 
<a href="../../Documentation/network/netboot/intro.javastation.html">javastation-specific
section</a> of the Diskless NetBSD HOW-TO. 


<h2><a name="krups">JavaStation-10 (a.k.a. JavaStation-NC or "Krups")</a></h2>

All JavaStation-10 units have Open Firmware.

<p>There is support for text console on these units.

<p>While the XFree86 server supports the framebuffer chipset used in
these units, the chips are located on the PCI bus, which is problematic
since no other NetBSD/sparc models have PCI busses.  It should be possible
to eventually support X on these units.
