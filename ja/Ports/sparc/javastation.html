<h1>NetBSD/sparc JavaStation Support</h1>

<hr>

<h3>Patching NetBSD-current</h3>

JavaStation support is still "experimental" and requires patches that
are not in the main source for the NetBSD kernel.
Contact <a href="mailto:uwe@ptc.spbu.ru">Valeriy E. Ushakov</a> for the current
status of JavaStation support and for the latest patches.


<h3>JavaStation-1 (a.k.a. "Mr.Coffee") Support:</h3>

As mentioned in the <a href="faq.html#javastation-supported">FAQ</a>,
there are two types of JavaStation-1 units -- those with OpenBoot PROM 2
(OBP2), and those with Open Firmware (OFW).  Which type of boot ROM you
have affects how you will boot your system and what devices are supported. 

<p>The banner the JavaStation displays at boot-time indicates which is present.
If it displays "<tt>OpenBoot 2.30</tt>", it has OpenBoot PROM 2.  If it
displays "<tt>OpenBoot 3.x</tt>" (where x is usually 10 or 11), it has
Open Firmware.

<p>Unfortunately, the OpenBoot PROM 2 does not properly initialize the
PS/2 style keyboard/mouse controller. This means you can't configure the
PROM without a serial console.  The JavaStation kernel patches support PS/2
keyboards, so you can use the keyboard once the NetBSD kernel is loaded. 

<p>Open Firmware has no PS/2 keyboard/mouse issues.

<p>The Xsun X11R6 server works with the PS/2 keyboard and mouse
(kernel patches not committed).

<p>Audio playback and recording work.

<p>OpenBoot PROM 2-based JavaStation-1 units will netboot like any other
NetBSD/sparc machine.  See the 
<a href="../../Documentation/network/netboot/intro.sun.html">sparc-specific
section</a> of the Diskless NetBSD HOW-TO. 

<p>Open Firmware-based JavaStation-1 units will netboot like any other
modern machine -- they send a DHCP request for a TFTP server and
bootloader filename, then download and execute that file.  These units
require a different bootloader than other NetBSD/sparc machines.  Make
sure you use <tt>bootjs.net</tt> from the snapshot or distribution.  See the 
<a href="../../Documentation/network/netboot/intro.javastation.html">javastation-specific
section</a> of the Diskless NetBSD HOW-TO. 


<h3>JavaStation-10 (a.k.a. JavaStation-NC or "Krups") Support</h3>

As mentioned in the <a href="faq.html#javastation-supported">FAQ</a>,
all JavaStation-10 units have Open Firmware.

<p>Open Firmware has no PS/2 keyboard/mouse issues.

<p>There is support for text console on these units.

<p>While the XFree86 server supports the framebuffer chipset used in
these units, the chips are located on the PCI bus, which is problematic
since no other NetBSD/sparc models have PCI busses.  It should be possible
to eventually support X on these units.

<p>Audio playback and recording work.

modern machine -- they send a DHCP request for a TFTP server and
