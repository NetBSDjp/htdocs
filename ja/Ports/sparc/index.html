<h1>NetBSD/sparc</h1>

<p>
NetBSD/sparc 1.3.3 is the fourth formal release of
<a href="../../Ports/sparc/index.html">NetBSD/sparc</a>.

<p>
NetBSD/sparc is based on work done at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
by the Computer Systems Engineering group under DARPA contract BG 91-66,
which later appeared in the 4.4BSD-Lite distribution from the University
of California, Berkeley.  It was imported into the NetBSD source tree on
October 2, 1993.  Special thanks are extended to the LBL Computer Systems
Engineering group for their work.  Without it, the port would not exist.

<p>
Paul Kranenburg is the maintainer of NetBSD/sparc.

<p>As of May 4th 1998, NetBSD/sparc -current is one of the ports using
<strong><a href="../../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html">UVM</a></strong>;
the new, vastly improved virtual memory system.
There is also a list of NetBSD/sparc
<a href="../../Changes/source-changes.html#port-sparc">-current changes</a>.

	<li> sun4 machines: 4/100, 4/200, and 4/300
	<li> sun4c-compatible "clones" should work. Positive
	     reports have been received on:
	     <ul>
		<li>Aries Research Inc, Parrot II (Sparcstation 2 clone)
		<li>Opus/5000 (Sparcstation 1 clone)
		<li>Opus/5250 (Sparcstation 1 clone)
	     </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> SCSI interfaces:
    <ul>
	<li> NCR53c9x-based on-board and Sbus SCSI interface (<i>esp</i>)
	     on sun4m, sun4c, and 4/300 systems (on-board only on 4/300)
	<li> NCR5380-based VME SCSI interface (<i>si</i>).
	     <b>Interrupt driven and polled DMA function on the <i>si</i>.</b>
	<li> NCR5380-based on-board SCSI interface on 4/100 (<i>sw</i>).
	     <b>Polled DMA now works on the <i>sw</i>.  Interrupt driven
	     DMA does not currently work.</b>
    </ul>
    <li> Disks:
    <ul>
	<li> most SCSI disks and CD-ROMs
	<li> SMD disks connected to Xylogics 753/7053 (<i>xd</i>)
	     or Xylogics 450/451 (<i>xy</i>) VME controllers
	<li> built-in floppy drive on sun4c and sun4m systems
    </ul>
    <li> Tape drives:
    <ul>
	<li> most SCSI tape drives
    </ul>
    <li> Serial interfaces:
    <ul>
	<li> built-in Zilog 8530 serial ports (much improved performance in
	     the NetBSD 1.3 release), which can be used as the system console
	     if desired.
    </ul>
    <li> Network interfaces:
    <ul>
	<li> on-board and Sbus LANCE ethernet found on sun4m, sun4c,
	     and 4/300 (on-board only on 4/300)
	<li> the LANCE ethernet component of FSBE/S Sbus cards
	<li> on-board and VME/multibus Intel ethernet found
	     on sun4 systems
    </ul>
    <li> Framebuffers:
    <ul>
	<li> on-board and Sbus bwtwo.  bwtwo driver also supports attaching
	     a bwtwo instance to the overlay plane of P4 cgfour and P4 cgeight
	     framebuffers.
	<li> VME cgtwo
	<li> Sbus cgthree
	<li> Sbus cgsix
	<li> P4 framebuffers found on 4/100 and 4/300 systems: bwtwo, cgfour,
	     cgsix, and cgeight.
	     <b>Note: cgeight support is not well tested.</b>
	<li> Sbus tcx	(kernel support limited to cgthree emulation)
	<li> Sbus cgfourteen	(kernel support limited to cgthree emulation)
    </ul>
    <li> Input devices:
    <ul>
	<li> Sun keyboard and mouse
    </ul>
    <li> Miscellaneous:
    <ul>
	<li> on-board audio on sun4c systems and, sun4m SPARCStation Classic
	     systems.
	<li> CS4231-based Sbus audio boards
	     <b>Note: currently the driver is output-only.</b>
    </ul>
</ul>
NetBSD/sparc also supports all the devices listed under the <a href="../../Hardware/sbus.html">Machine-independent SBUS drivers</a> page.

<p>
If you have a device that's not listed, it might be compatible with something
else, or we might have simply forgotten it.  If all else fails, maybe you could
write a driver!

<p>
Major items often asked about, but not yet supported include:
<ul>
    <li>sun4d-class CPUs
    <li>sun4u-class CPUs (though a sparc64 port is being integrated)
    <li>audio on sun4m machines (other than mentioned above)
    <li>Sun <a href="../../contrib/hardware.html#sun-vme-sc-scsi">VME 'sc'
	SCSI card</a>.
</ul>

<h3>SunOS and Solaris compatibility</h3>

<p> The NetBSD/sparc port features extensive binary compatibility with
SunOS 4.1.x programs.  Statically linked SunOS executables will run with
minimal setup.  To run dynamically linked executables, you'll need to
provide the shared libraries that came with your SunOS installation.
See NetBSD's <i>compat_sunos(8)</i> manual page for more details.
SunOS programs that will <i>not</i> work include those that use the SunOS
kvm library, certain (low-level) disk manipulation utilities, and programs
making explicit use of Sun's STREAMS subsystem.  NetBSD/sparc also includes
some support of Solaris 2.x binaries, implemented similar to the SunOS 4.1.x
binary compatibility, and is documented in <i>compat_svr4(8)</i>. </p>
