<SECTION>General Questions

<ENTRY>le0-not-multicast-capable No multicast or IPv6 - \
	"<tt>le0: not multicast capable</tt>"
The LANCE revsision C chips used in some sun3s (not the sun3x) have
a bug which sometimes results in garbage inserted where the first
bits should be, with the correct bits shifted later.  So instead
of the destination MAC address at the beginning, you get something
random looking.
<p>

The work-around is to examine the beginning of the packet and
throw away anything that's not for us (my MAC or broadcast).
Unfortunately this prevents the use of multicast.
<p>

The LANCE Rev. C chip was probably only used in the 3/50, so on
other sun3 machines you should be able to <a

a kernel</a> without the line:  <pre>options LANCE_REVC_BUG</pre>

<ENTRY>3-80-esp-endless-reset Running diskless 3/80 with ESP driver - \
	<tt>"esp: SCSI bus reset."</tt>
This message is a symptom of a bug in the esp driver on diskless systems.
The ESP (Emulex SCSI Processor) driver in NetBSD/sun3x has a bug that causes
it to enter an endless loop when it probes an empty SCSI bus.
To work around this problem, use a kernel which does not have the esp device
driver, or plug in at least one powered SCSI device into the bus.
(Sorry, we don't have a pre-compiled esp-less kernel for you yet!)

<ENTRY>sunos_compat SunOS 4.1 Compatibility
NetBSD/Sun3 features extensive binary compatibility with
SunOS 4.1.x programs.  Static SunOS executables will run without any
extra setup.
<p>

To run dynamic executables, you'll need to provide the
dynamic libraries that came with your SunOS installation.
SunOS programs that will <i>not</i> work include those that use the
SunOS kvm library, certain (low-level) disk manipulation utilities,
and programs making explicit use of Sun's STREAMS subsystem.
Check the compat_sunos(8) manual page for more details.

<ENTRY>sun3x-history History of NetBSD/sun3x
The sun3x port of NetBSD was initiated by two independent groups of
developers.  The first group, headed by Gordon Ross and Jeremy Cooper,
began work in March of 1996 with the (then) current sun3 port and the
intent to create a new pmap system that was not based on the hp300 m68k
code.  Their work is the officially supported version of NetBSD/sun3x.
<p>

The second group, headed by Tsubai Masanari, also began with the sun3
distribution but instead choose to use the traditional hp300 m68k pmap.
This approach allowed them to get a fully running system in a matter
of weeks.  They were the first to successfully integrate the SPARC
Enhanced SCSI Processor driver into the kernel, proving that the Sun3x
was indeed half SPARC, half Sun3.
<p>

Although the currently supported NetBSD/sun3x is based on Gordon and
Jeremy's work, they are indebted to the second group for their innovation.
<p>

Between NetBSD 1.3 and 1.4 NetBSD/sun3x was merged into NetBSD/sun3.
They build separate kernels, but share the same userland, and kernel
build tree.
