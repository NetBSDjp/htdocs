<dt><b>2001-11-18:</b> NetBSD/i386 on IBM PS/2 (MCA) machines
    <dd>Jaromir Dolecek is happy to announce that the IBM PS/2 (MCA) machine
    support in <a href="../Releases/current.html">NetBSD-current</a> has
    reached the point where it's usable for general work and should
    provide stable multiuser server.  The system installation tool
    (sysinst) was also change to support installation on this class of
    i386 machines.  See the INSTALL documents for exact details, like
    which boot floppies to use for installation, etc.  The next major
    Until the next major release (NetBSD 1.6), PS/2 support will only
    be available thru NetBSD/i386 -current <a
    href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/i386/snapshot/">binary
    snapshots</a>.
    <p>
    The development on this support will, of course, continue, with more
    device drivers to be written as well as expanded documentation.

<dt><b>2001-08-09:</b> Kernel support for SSE/SSE2
    <dd>Jason Thorpe has added the necessary kernel support for SSE/SSE2
    to NetBSD/i386 -current.  The kernel needed to know about the
    extended FPU save format, and initialize the MXCSR properly for the
    new processes.
    <p>
    Note that ptrace(2)/procfs and coredumps will not contain SSE/SSE2
    state; we need to come up with interfaces to expose that information
    (the same problem exists for PowerPC AltiVEC).
    <p>
    In order to use SSE/SSE2, you'll need an updated assembler.  The
    in-tree gas is too old to understand the SSE/SSE2 insns, but this should
    change soon.

<dt><b>2000-09-07:</b> Initial support for large pages
    <dd>Jason Thorpe has added support for mapping the kernel text using large
    pages to NetBSD-current/i386.  This gives a reasonable performance
    improvement.  For example, building a GENERIC kernel on a 600MHz P-III
    laptop:
    <p>
    <dl><dd>
    before: 636.59s real   387.34s user    27.53s system
    <p>
    after: 597.21s real   382.88s user    24.88s system
    </dd></dl>
    <p>
    Note that compiling stuff is userland-intensive, so things that spend a
    lot more time in the kernel (e.g forwarding packets, IPsec processing,
    RAIDframe, etc.) are likely to see better improvements.
    <p>
    This is initial support for large pages, so there is <b>not</b> generic
    support for using large pages for other types of mappings yet, nor is
    there support for mapping the kernel data/bss segments with large pages
    (although that should be pretty straightforward).
    <p>
    An example kernel config can be found in <a
    href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/syssrc/sys/arch/i386/conf/DR-EVIL.4MB?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">sys/arch/i386/conf/DR-EVIL.4MB</a>.
    Follow its lead to learn how to enable large page support.

<dd>NetBSD version 1.3.3 released.  NetBSD 1.3.3 is a stability release
containing fixes (among them, important security fixes) for those
wanting or needing to run stable code and which have been running
version 1.3.2 or earlier software on their systems.
Note that if you have already been using an earlier snapshot of
NetBSD-current, installing 1.3.3 would actually <i>downgrade</i> your
system.

<p>   
<dt><b>1998-12-10</b>
<dd>New binary snapshot available. Of major note since the last snapshot is
that an egcs compiler fix has been implemented in <tt>global.c</tt> which
should fix the problems some have had with the <i>we</i> ethernet
driver.

<dd>New binary snapshot available. A few notes:
<ol>
<li>This snapshot has been built with egcs 1.1.1-pre-release and
with gas.new.
<li>The GENERIC kernels in this snapshot contain the PS/2 mouse
device driver (<em>pms0</em>).  The problems which earlier caused it
to be excluded are now thought to be gone.  Note that if your
system has many PCI devices, your BIOS should now prevent
allocation of irq number 12 to PCI devices, as the pms0 device
will now claim that interrupt.
</ol>

<dt><b>1998-11-16</b>

<dd>A driver for 3Com 90xB boards added (the <em>ex</em> driver).  This
driver provides DMA support for the 90x and 90xB cards, and hopefully
better performance than the old PIO-based driver (which could not be
used on the 90xB cards).
