    <dd>NetBSD's i386 port supports up to 16 partitions per disk in -current.
    Before you can use this you have to update your complete source, rebuild
    the kernel and userland, and invoke the latest "src/etc/etc.i386/MAKEDEV"
    in "/dev" to create the additional device nodes.  If you do use more than
    8 partitions per disk, you won't be able to cleanly downgrade to an
    earlier NetBSD version.

    They are located in lang/sun-jdk13 and lang/sun-jre13 respectively.  For
    JRE only, install sun-jre13; for full JDK, install sun-jdk13 (which
    will install sun-jre13 as a dependency).  You should have no problems

    <dd>Jason Thorpe has added support for mapping the kernel text using large
    pages to NetBSD-current/i386.  This gives a reasonable performance
    improvement for compiling, and things that spend a lot of time in the
    kernel (e.g forwarding packets, IPsec processing, RAIDframe, etc.) will
    see better improvements.
    This initial support was developed at and contributed by <a

version 1.3.2 or earlier software on their systems.

<li>This snapshot has been built with egcs 1.1.1-pre-release and
with gas.new.
<li>The GENERIC kernels in this snapshot contain the PS/2 mouse
device driver (<em>pms0</em>).  The problems which earlier caused it
to be excluded are now thought to be gone.  Note that if your
system has many PCI devices, your BIOS should now prevent
allocation of irq number 12 to PCI devices, as the pms0 device
will now claim that interrupt.
