<dt><b>July 05, 1999:</b> Switch to ELF format
<dd>NetBSD/i386 has switched from the a.out executable format
    to <a href="../../Documentation/elf.html">ELF</a>.  For those
    running -current see <a
    href="../../Documentation/elf.html#updating-from-a.out">notes
    on upgrading from a.out</a>.

<p>
<dt><b>August 26, 1999:</b> NetBSD-1.4.1 released
<dd>The <a href="../../Releases/formal-1.4/">NetBSD 1.4.1</a>
    release supports sixteen architectures, and was distributed
    free by <a href="http://www.usenix.org/">Usenix</a> to all 1999
    ATC attendees.

<p>
<dt><b>December 23, 1998</b>
<dd><a href="../../Changes/#23_Dec_1998_NetBSD_1_3_3_Released">
    NetBSD version 1.3.3</a> released.  NetBSD 1.3.3 is a stability release
    containing fixes (among them, important security fixes) for those
    wanting or needing to run stable code and which have been running
    version 1.3.2 or earlier software on their systems.<p>

    Note that if you have already been using an earlier snapshot of
    NetBSD-current, installing 1.3.3 would actually <i>downgrade</i> your
    system.
 
<p>   
<dt><b>December 10, 1998</b>
<dd>New binary snapshot available. Of major note since the last snapshot is
    that an egcs compiler fix has been implemented in <tt>global.c</tt> which
    should fix the problems some have had with the <i>we</i> ethernet
    driver.

<p>
<dt><b>November 18, 1998</b>
<dd>New binary snapshot available. A few notes:
<ol>
  <li>This snapshot has been built with egcs 1.1.1-pre-release and
      with gas.new.

  <li>The GENERIC kernels in this snapshot contain the PS/2 mouse
      device driver (<em>pms0</em>).  The problems which earlier caused it
      to be excluded are now thought to be gone.  Note that if your
      system has many PCI devices, your BIOS should now prevent
      allocation of irq number 12 to PCI devices, as the pms0 device
      will now claim that interrupt.
</ol>

<p>
<dt><b>November 16, 1998</b>
<dd>The i386 port has now switched to using egcs and gas.new.

<p>
<dt><b>November 3, 1998</b>
<dd>A driver for 3Com 90xB boards added (the <em>ex</em> driver).  This
    driver provides DMA support for the 90x and 90xB cards, and hopefully
    better performance than the old PIO-based driver (which could not be
    used on the 90xB cards).

<p>
<dt><b>October 12, 1998</b>
<dd>Major changes to the IDE code for better error handling, improved
    ATAPI support, 32 bit data I/O support and bus-master DMA
    support on PCI IDE controllers.
   
<p> 
<dt><b>September 26, 1998</b>
<dd>Support for the AdvanSys Ultra Wide boards added (the <em>adw</em>
    driver).  These boards are quite different from the other AdvanSys
    boards which are supported by the <em>adv</em> driver.  This adds
    support for the ABP-9xxUW cards.

<p>
<dt><b>August 31, 1998</b>
<dd>The i386 port switched to using <a
    href="../../Documentation/kernel/uvm.html"><strong>UVM</strong></a>;
    the new, vastly improved virtual memory system.

<p>
<dt><b>August 26, 1998</b>
<dd>Driver for the AdvanSys PCI SCSI controllers added (the <em>adv</em>
    driver).  This supports the following cards:
    <ul>
      <li>ABP-9xx
      <li>ABP-9xxU
      <li>ABP-9xxUA
    </ul>

<p>
<dt><b>July 12, 1998</b>
<dd><a href="../../Hardware/usb.html">USB</a> support added.  USB is only
    supported for i386 initially, but it should be easy to add to other PCI
    platforms as well.
