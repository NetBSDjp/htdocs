    Some early IBM Personal System/2 machines are equipped with
    MCA bus, IBM proprietary bus technology comparable to speed
    and features with e.g. PCI, VESA or EISA. This project aims at
    supporting these i386-based PS/2 machines.
    <p>

    MicroChannel Architecture (MCA) was developed by IBM as full
    featured system bus for use on theirs servers and personal computers.
    Besides being using in PS/2, RS/6000 and AS/400, NCR and Apricot also
    made MCA clones. There is also MCA-based Tandy Model 5000.<br>
    However, MCA failed to become significant industry standard
    (partly due to IBM keeping the technology proprietary) and other
    vendors went with EISA and later with PCI.
    <p>

    MCA supports clean plug-and-play capability, has very advanced
    bus mastering capability (to some regard better than PCI), supports
    up to 65280 device addresses. Supported transfer speed
    is up to 160 MBytes/sec on 32-bit MCA.
    <p>

    Original support for MCA-based IBM PS/2 machines was
    written by <a href="mailto:s.telford@ed.ac.uk">Scott D. Telford</a>
    (see also his <a href="http://www.devnull.demon.co.uk/netbsd-mca.html">MCA
    page</a>).
    His code was used also in several non-NetBSD MCA activities, namely for
    <a href="http://www.dgmicro.com/">MCA Linux Project</a>
    and on <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD</a>.
    <a href="mailto:g.mcgarry@ieee.org">Gregory McGarry</a> was also
    involved in NetBSD MCA development. Current maintainer of NetBSD MCA is
    <a href="mailto:jdolecek@NetBSD.org">Jaromir Dolecek</a>.

    List of <a href="../../Hardware/mca.html">supported MCA devices</a>
    is on separate page.
    <p>

    If no native MCA driver exists and an
    ISA variant of the card is supported (check
    <a href="../../Hardware/mca.html">supported ISA devices</a>), it might
    still work if you configure your kernel appropriately, giving correct
    I/O and/or memory address and IRQ number. An ultimate goal is to have
    MCA drivers for all MCA hardware, but this may help you get off ground.

    <p>

    Following is list of devices, which are not supported at the moment,
    but we get lots of queries about and are likely to be supported "soon":

    <ul>
    <li> IBM PS/2 MCA SCSI Adapter (<em>work on driver underway</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    There is also other hardware we would like to support, but we lack
    either the hardware or necessary documentation to write the driver.
    If you'd be willing to contribute either, check our the
    <a href="../../contrib/hardware.html#mca-cards-wanted">MCA cards and
    documentation wanted</a> list, and/or contact 
    <a href="mailto:jdolecek@NetBSD.org">Jaromir Dolecek</a>. Generally,
    we would like to support as much different hardware as possible, so
    please let us know even when you'd be willing to contribute hardware
    which is not on the list.

    IBM PS/2 MCA support is in NetBSD tree since 2000/05/11 and work
    on further support continues since then. The IBM PS/2 suppport got
    useful enough for use during spring 2001. Upcoming NetBSD 1.6 release
    is going to have PS/2 boot/installation floppies and generally support
    PS/2 well. Until then, you'd need to use NetBSD -current and make
    necessary boot floppies yourself. Snapshots of the work might be
    available at <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/mca/">NetBSD
    ftp site</a>.
    <p>

    If you got problems, ask on
    <a href="mailto:port-i386@NetBSD.org">port-i386@NetBSD.org</a> mailing
    list. If you find something working incorrectly, please let us
    know about the problem via <tt>send-pr</tt>
    or to <a href="mailto:jdolecek@NetBSD.org">Jaromir Dolecek</a> directly.
    <p>

    Unless you have an ESDI controller/disk or AHA-1640 SCSI controller,
    the best way how to use your PS/2 is to make it diskless.
    You still need to boot from floppy in that case though.
