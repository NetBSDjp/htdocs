<SECTION>General Questions

<ENTRY>ec-nfs NFS client with a 3Com 3c400 (<tt>ec</tt>) card
The 3Com 3c400 (<tt>ec</tt>) Multibus Ethernet card can only buffer two 
received Ethernet packets, regardless of their length, before it starts 
dropping packets.  Unless overridden, an NFS client read requests 8
kilobytes at a time.  This means six or more packets will be sent by 
the server, usually quickly enough to fill the card and cause the third 
and subsequent packets to get dropped.

<p>
NFS has an all-or-nothing mentality about it, so the client will throw
away any packets it did get and just send the request again, making
for a vicious cycle.  The solution is to tell NFS to only request 1
kilobyte at a time, done by adding an option to the client's mount command:

<p>
<tt>mount -t nfs -o -r=1024 <i>server</i>:<i>directory</i> <i>mountpoint</i></tt>

<ENTRY>sunos_compat SunOS Compatibility
NetBSD/sun2 will one day feature extensive binary compatibility with
SunOS 3 and SunOS 4 programs, however this work has not been done yet.

<ENTRY>sun2-history History of NetBSD/sun2
The sun2 port of NetBSD was started by Matt Fredette in January 2001.
He began working with <a href="../sun3/">NetBSD/sun3</a> from the 1.5 
release and after a few months had it booting multiuser.  In April
2001 he began merging the port into the NetBSD tree.
