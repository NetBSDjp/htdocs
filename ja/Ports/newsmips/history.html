<h1>History of machines running NetBSD/newsmips and NetBSD/news68k</h1>

<hr>
<p>

Sony has good
"<a href="http://www.sony.co.jp/Fun/SH/2-12/h2.html">Sony History</a>"
pages, but they were never translated to English.
<a href="http://www.sony.co.jp/en/Fun/SH/">English pages
</a> are being updated monthly,
but the NEWS chapter will appear in the future.
<p>

According to that page, the first NEWS
machine appeared in January 1987, in Japan.
It was NWS-800, which is not supported by NetBSD/news68k as of this writing.
It was designed for replacement of VAX mini-computers on desktop.
The price was 950,000-2,750,000 Yen ($8800-$25000 US) and they were selling
very well in Japan. The NEWS machines were used for DTP, CAD/CAM etc.
They were sold in USA and Europe (there are a few user of
NetBSD/news68k in USA  and Italy) but the sales were
hard because Sun Microsystems already had big market share.
<p>

Sony released the newer MIPS based NEWS around 1991(?)
and they were used for VOD system and internet server etc.
Note that the 4.4BSD/Lite release also supported the news3400 models.
Finally the NEWS division in Sony has been dissolved in 1998.
