    Sony has good pages about it's history in both 
    <ulink url="http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/SonyHistory/">Japanese</ulink> and
    <ulink url="http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/">English</ulink>
    language. 
    There is also a NEWS chapter available in both
    <ulink url="http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/SonyHistory/2-12.html#block2">Japanese</ulink> and
    <ulink url="http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-23/h2.html">English</ulink>.
    (Note "MIPS" in this article stands for
    "Media Information Products and System"
    Business Group, not the MIPS processors.)

    According to that page, the first NEWS
    machine appeared in January 1987, in Japan.
    It was NWS-800, which is not supported by NetBSD/news68k as of this writing.
    It was designed for replacement of VAX mini-computers on desktop.
    The price was 950,000-2,750,000 Yen ($8800-$25000 US) and they were selling
    very well in Japan. The NEWS machines were used for DTP, CAD/CAM etc.
    They were sold in USA and Europe (there are a few user of
    NetBSD/news68k in USA and Italy) but the sales were
    hard because Sun Microsystems already had big market share.
  </para>

  <para>
    Sony released the newer MIPS based NEWS (NWS-3800) in December 1989,
    and they were used for VOD system and internet server etc.
    Note that the 4.4BSD/Lite release also supported the news3400 models.
    Finally the NEWS division in Sony has been dissolved in 1998.
