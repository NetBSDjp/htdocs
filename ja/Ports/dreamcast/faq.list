<h1>NetBSD/dreamcast Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

It is intended for this to become a repository of frequently asked questions
(and answers) specific to NetBSD/dreamcast.

<LIST>

<ENTRY>file-through-bba How do I send a file through my Broadband Adapter
Sending a file from a computer running NetBSD to your SEGA Dreamcast
through your SEGA Broadband Adapter isn't complicated.  First, you
should type: 
<p>
<tt># mkdir /p<br>
# mount_portal /usr/share/examples/mount_portal/tcp.1.conf /p</tt>
<p>
After that, to send a file you would type:
<p>
<tt># cat <i>filename</i> &gt; /p/tcp/<i>dreamcast</i>/4711</tt>
<p>
where '<i>filename</i>' is the name of the file you wish to send, and 
'<i>dreamcast</i>' is the hostname or IP address of your SEGA Dreamcast.
The "4711" means TCP port 4711 on the Dreamcast.

<ENTRY>juggler How do I make a working boot CD with DiskJuggler?
<ul>
<li>Get a DiskJuggler bootable image (e.g. the one from 
<a href="http://www.roadsign.com/dc/netbsd.zip">http://www.roadsign.com/dc/netbsd.zip</a> which contains a .cdi file). 
<li>Install a known-to-work version of DiskJuggler (such as V3.50.800-DTU).
<li>Click 'File' and then 'New' to start a new task. Select 'CD Image to CD 
Recorder'.
<li>Click the icon under the word Source in the upper left of the window. 
Use the browser to find the .cdi file.
<li>Insert a blank CD into the recorder and click Start.
</ul>

<ENTRY>snapshots Where do I find snapshots
You find NetBSD/dreamcast snapshots at
<URL>ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/dreamcast/snapshot/ . 
As the Dreamcast port is binary compatible to other SH-based
ports, you can also use snapshots from e.g. the hpcsh port, located
at <URL>ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/hpcsh/snapshot/ .
