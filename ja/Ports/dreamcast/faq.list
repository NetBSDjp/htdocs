<h1>NetBSD/dreamcast Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>
It is intended for this to become a repository of frequently asked questions
(and answers) specific to NetBSD/dreamcast.  It is currently still very
incomplete with glaring omissions and oddities.  Be assured that there is work
progressing to further enhance and expand this document.  If your question
remains unanswered then please consider submitting it to the NetBSD/dreamcast
mailing list.

<LIST>

<ENTRY>port_origins Where did the Dreamcast port come from?

It was spun off from the <a href="../evbsh3/">NetBSD/evbsh3</a> port by Marcus
Comstedt after Saitoh Masanobu managed to boot the evbsh3 code on a Dreamcast
console.

<ENTRY>cd-r_bootable Can all Dreamcast consoles boot from CD-R?
The "Sakura Wars Limited Edition" is known to be incapable of booting from
CD-R.  There may be others also.

<ENTRY>cd-rw_bootable Can any Dreamcast consoles boot from CD-RW?
There have been unsubstantiated rumours that a very small subset of Dreamcast
consoles are capable of booting from CD-RW without modification.  Many others
are capable of this with internal modification to the console.

<ENTRY>what_is_bba What is the Broadband Adapter?
Often abbreviated as `BBA', the Broadband Adapter is 10/100Mbit Ethernet
module that replaces the console's modem.  It is driven by a Realtek 8139 chip
that runs from a PCI bus in the Broadband Adapter.  The PCI bus is then
translated into the console's native G2 Bus.

<ENTRY>where_is_bba Where can I get a Broadband Adapter?
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> is a likely place and sometimes <a
href="http://www.lik-sang.com/">Lik-Sang</a> or <a
href="http://www.lan-kwei.com/">Lan-Kwei</a> have some.  You could also
investigate the availability of the Dreamcast R7 console which is reported to
have come with a Broadband Adapter pre-installed.  They are generally very
difficult to find now that Sega has ended Dreamcast production.  As such,
highly inflated prices are often seen, with many Broadband Adapters selling for
greater than the cost of the console they are to be employed in.

<ENTRY>what_is_la What is the LAN Adapter?
The LAN Adapter (HIT-0300) is essentially a Broadband Adapter with support for
10Mbit rather than 10/100Mbit Ethernet.  It uses the MB86967 chip instead of
the Broadband Adapter's Realtek 8139.

<ENTRY>where_is_la Where can I get a LAN Adapter?
Some people have found the LAN Adapter more available than the actual Broadband
Adapter but definitive sources of purchase are unavailable.  It was produced
exclusively for the Japanese market but has been known to be exported
unofficially to other countries by third-parties.

<ENTRY>where_images Where can I find a bootable NetBSD/dreamcast CD image?
There are some old but useful DiskJuggler images at <a
href="http://www.roadsign.com/dc/">http://www.roadsign.com/dc/</a>.

<ENTRY>where_dj Where can I find DiskJuggler?
DiskJuggler is freely available (albeit in a crippled form, but still
functional enough to burn the aforementioned images) from <a
href="http://www.padus.com/free.htm">http://www.padus.com/free.htm</a>.

<ENTRY>how_bootable_image How do I make a bootable NetBSD/dreamcast CD image?
That is entirely dependent on your choice of CD burning software.  Marcus
Comstedt has information on using cdrecord at <a
href="http://mc.pp.se/dc/cdr.html">http://mc.pp.se/dc/cdr.html</a> while
information for using Ahead's Nero can be found at <a
href="http://nero.julesdcdev.com/">http://nero.julesdcdev.com/</a>.

<ENTRY>how_compile_win How do I compile NetBSD/dreamcast under Windows?
To build NetBSD/dreamcast under Windows will take a functional Cygwin
installation, a working sh4 cross-compiler, the NetBSD code and a great deal of
patience.  More detail will hopefully be made available in the not too distant
future.

<ENTRY>how_send_files How do I send files to the Dreamcast?
The simplest solution for those running NetBSD or similar is to use the portal
filesystem as follows:

<p>
<tt># mkdir /p</tt><br>
<tt># mount_portal /usr/share/examples/mount_portal/tcp.1.conf /p</tt>
</p>

Now that the portal filesystem is mounted <tt>cat</tt> can be employed to send
a file to the console:

<p>
<tt># cat <i>filename</i> &gt; /p/tcp/<i>dreamcast</i>/<i>port</i></tt><br>
</p>

Where `<i>filename</i>' is the file to send, `<i>dreamcast</i>' is the IP
address of the console and `<i>port</i>' is the port number to send the file
to.  An example of sending a kernel called `<tt>bsd</tt>' to a Dreamcast with
an IP address of <tt>192.168.0.128</tt> which is running the IP upload slave
(which listens on port <tt>4711</tt>) would be:

<p>
<tt># cat bsd &gt; /p/tcp/192.168.0.128/4711</tt>
</p>

<ENTRY>what_ip_slave What is the IP upload slave?
The IP upload slave is a Dreamcast program written by Marcus Comstedt that
allows the transport of files through the Dreamcast console's Broadband
Adapter, which will then be executed by the console.  It can be found at <a
href="http://mc.pp.se/dc/ipslave.html">http://mc.pp.se/dc/ipslave.html</a>.

<ENTRY>how_set_ip How do I set the IP address of the Dreamcast?
Certain Dreamcast games can set the IP address, which is then stored by the
console until altered.  Similarly the Broadband Passport browser software has
this capability.  However, the Dreamcast can be told its IP address once NetBSD
has been booted and doesn't need the information prior to this, as such, the
simplest solution is to edit the arp table from your NetBSD system like so:

<p>
<tt># arp -s <i>dreamcast</i> <i>ethernet</i></tt>
</p>

Where `<i>dreamcast</i>' is the desired IP address, say <tt>192.168.0.128</tt>,
and `<i>ethernet</i>' is the hardware address of the Broadband Adapter, say
<tt>00:00:de:ad:be:ef</tt> the command would be:

<p>
<tt># arp -s 192.168.0.128 00:00:de:ad:be:ef</tt>
</p>

The hardware address of the Broadband Adapter can be found written on the
device itself or transcribed from the IP upload slave program.

<ENTRY>where_browser Can I get a GD-ROM of the Dreamcast Browser to set the IP address?
Try <a href="http://newbrowser.sega.com/">http://newbrowser.sega.com/"</a>.
The chances of coercing this system into delivering anywhere outside the USA
appear slim.

<ENTRY>endian Is the Hitachi SuperH SH-4 little or big endian?
It can be driven either way but the Dreamcast uses it in a little endian
fashion.

<ENTRY>where_snapshots Where do I find NetBSD/dreamcast snapshots?
You can find NetBSD/dreamcast snapshots at <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/dreamcast/snapshot/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/dreamcast/snapshot/</a>.<br>
As the Dreamcast port is binary compatible to other sh-based ports, you can
also use snapshots from these projects, such as the NetBSD/hpcsh port, located
at <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/hpcsh/snapshot/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/hpcsh/snapshot/</a>.
