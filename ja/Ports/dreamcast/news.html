<dt><b>2001-02-02:</b> Support for the SEGA Broadband Adapter
    <dd>Marcus Comstedt and Jason Thorpe have added support for the
    SEGA Broadband Adapter to the NetBSD/dreamcast port.  This
    allows NetBSD/dreamcast to run from an NFS root file system.
    In addition to the Broadband Adapter, the keyboard and display
    console support has been improved.
    <p>
    A <a href="dmesg/010202.txt">session transcript</a> from a telnet
    login to a Dreamcast running NetBSD on an NFS root is available.
    The kernel was loaded over the Broadband Adapter using Marcus'
    IP-slave boot loader.

<dt><b>2001-01-22:</b> GD-ROM device driver working
    <dd>Marcus Comstedt has committed a working GD-ROM device driver.
    If you've burned a CD with NetBSD binaries, you can now type "gdrom0" when
    you get to the "root device" prompt (leave the dump device field empty,
    and type "cd9660" as file system).

<dt><b>2001-01-18:</b> Display and keyboard working within wscons
    <dd>Marcus Comstedt has gotten his display and keyboard drivers to work
    within the <a href="../../Documentation/wscons/">wscons</a> framework.
    There's still work to do, but booting up a single user shell with the
    screen and keyboard as console works fine.

<dt><b>2000-07-15:</b> Progress on Dreamcast port
    <dd>The port of the NetBSD operating system to Sega's Dreamcast game
    console is reaching a state where it's near to single user mode.
    Utilizing the NetBSD/evbsh3 port's simple structure and the fact that
    it supports both big and little endian architectures as well as the
    general clean design of the NetBSD operating system helped for this
    port. Device drivers for the game pad, keyboard etc. are next on the
    todo-list of Saitoh Masanobu, who works on this port.
