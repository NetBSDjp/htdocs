<dt><b>2003-01-05:</b> FAQ updated
   <dd>The <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> has been updated and been actualised.
   Added is the question how to boot an NC into NetBSD using the new boot32
   bootloader.
   <p>

<dt><b>2003-01-05:</b> Bootloader v3.01 has been released for testing
    <dd>The acorn32 portmaster Reinoud Zandijk has released version 3.01 of
    the bootloader. This new bootloader is a complete rewrite and comes as a
    NetBSD compilable single RISC OS relocatable module and is capable of
    booting all supported machines including NC's. It's still in development
    but ought to work fine for all users. You can download the latest released
    version of the module <a
    href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/acorn32/boot32,ffa">boot32</a>
    and give it a try. Please report problems to the mailing list or to the
    portmaster.

<dt><b>2001-12-19:</b> Improvements in Acorn NC support
    <dd>Ben Harris has modified the "<tt>ne at podulebus</tt>" driver to work
    around a bug in the MX98905 chip used on EtherI and EtherN cards, so they
    can now be used on NetBSD.  He has also tweaked the <tt>vidcvideo</tt>
    driver to find screen modes correctly on the ARM7500.  Between them, these
    allow an <tt>NC_WSCONS</tt> kernel to come up multi-user, with a proper
    display.
    <p>
    Ben is now working on getting X up and running on his Acorn NC.

<dt><b>2001-04-02:</b> Hardware scrolling for RiscPC/A7000/NC wscons
    <dd>Reinoud Zandijk has committed code for hardware scrolling for the
    RiscPC and compatibles.  This new code has been tested in different
    screen resolutions and depths, and its all worked ok so far.  It even
    appears to run faster than the original vidcconsole code.  More details
    are available in Reinoud's announcement in the <a
    href="http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/port-arm32/2001/04/01/0002.html">port-arm32
