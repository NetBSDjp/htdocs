<SECTION>NetBSD Questions

<ENTRY>crossbuild How can I start cross-builds?
See <a href="../../Documentation/cross/">Cross-building NetBSD</a>
for cross build in general.
<p>
Unfortunately, there is no generally available toolchain for building
sh5 binaries at this time. The port was brought up using a heavilly
modified port of gcc 2.97 by SuperH.
<p>
Work is on-going in gcc-current to provide a usable and stable sh5
compiler.

<SECTION>Hardware Questions

<ENTRY>evalcard Are there evaluation cards available for the SH-5?
We are only aware of SuperH's Cayman board at this time.
If you have any additions, please submit those to the
<a href="../../MailingLists/#port-sh5">port-sh5</A> mailing list.
<p>

The best place you could contact is
your local SuperH office (like SuperH US, SuperH UK, whatever).
They may have evaluation boards to sell to customers (since they would
like to sell the SH5 chips), possibly with localized documents.
