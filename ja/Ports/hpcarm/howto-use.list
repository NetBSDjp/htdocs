<h1>Using NetBSD/<font color="#657595">hpcarm</font></h1>

This page contains information that current and potential users of
NetBSD/hpcarm can use to help them set up and maintain their
systems.

<LIST>

<SECTION>Getting started with NetBSD/hpcarm

<ENTRY>files  Files to prepare
You need at least 3 files to start NetBSD/hpcarm.
<p>

<dl>
  <dt>hpcboot.exe
    <dd>bootloader which runs in the WindowsCE environment.
	It currently supports WinCE2.11 and PocketPC(WinCE 3.xx) machines.
	It is available at sys/arch/hpc/stand/binary/ARM/. (From the
        NetBSD-current sources; see <a
        href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/current/">Tracking
        NetBSD-current</a>.)
  <dt>netbsd (kernel)
    <dd>For testing: <URL>ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/hpcarm/snapshot/kernel/netbsd-20010224.
  <dt>miniroot.fs (filesystem image, generated with vnconfig) 
    <dd>Coming soon.
</dl>

<ENTRY>boot-flash  Booting from memory card
This is probably the easiest way, for now.
<p>

Connect some device to the serial port.
Use 19200bps, no parity, 8bits.
<p>

Prepare a DOS-formatted memory card, and copy the above 3 files
(currently only 2 files) onto the card.
<p>

Insert the card into your WinCE machine.
<p>

Checking: did you connect the serial cable already?  The serial cable
MUST be plugged into WinCE machine before starting hpcboot.exe.
<p>

Go into "Explorer" (not "Internet Explorer"), go one directory down to
your memory card (the name of the memory card differs by
localization), and invoke hpcboot.exe.  Alternatively, you may want to
setup autoboot, if your WinCE product allows you to.
<p>

In hpcboot, setup the following items.
<ul>
<li>"kernel" screen:
    <ul>
    <li>Line 1: set the pathname to "netbsd".
	Should be "\Storage Card 1\" (without the quotes) and
	"netbsd", or whatever is suitable.
    <li>Line 2: specify the machine type you are using.
	At this moment this should not matter too much.
	In the future, when we got X support, the information will be used to
	determine screen size and keyboard type.
    <li>Line 3 and 4: specify the filesystem type.
	At present, we have no miniroot.fs, so this option is meaningless. 
    <li>Line 5: You definitely want "Serial console". 
        For other items, choose as you like. 
    </ul>
</ul>

Pray.
Tap "boot" at the bottom.
You will see "Last chance: Push OK to boot" dialog.
Tap OK or return (obviously).
If you are successful, you will see
<a href="dmesg-iPAQ-2000-02-24.txt">boot message like this</a>
on your serial port.
Congratulations!
