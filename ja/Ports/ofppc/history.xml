    Being redirected by FirePower to EMS group in London,

  <para>
    When getting a Bull Estrella (essentially a Motorola Ultra Board with 603)
    with OpenFirmware, it took two days to adapt the port to the new machine.
    Most of the work was the addition of the 603 software TLB reload
    (for which the example code in the 603 manual is quite buggy).
  </para>

<sect1 id="sep_1996">

  <title>Spring 1997</title>
  <para>
    Unfortunately my development machine died.
    Since FirePower, after being bought out by Motorola,
    no longer is in the business of supporting their old machines,
    I'm stuck.
    This is the main reason (apart from lack of time) that further
    development of NetBSD/powerpc is only crawling.
  </para>
