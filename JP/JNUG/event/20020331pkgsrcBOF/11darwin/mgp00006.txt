Some applications require -no-cpp-precomp
Darwin has two versions of cpp. One comes from GNU, the other one was made by Apple to support precompile headers. Apple's version is used by default and some applications don't like it. If you get strange compilation errors related to macros, try to use -no-cpp-precomp option.

-Wl,-R and other linker options
We have -Wl,-Rsomedir throughout pkgsrc, but darwin's ld doesn't understand it. Also we must use the following options:

                -dynamiclib: to build shared library, not -shared.
                -fno-common: to build shared library, not PIC option.
