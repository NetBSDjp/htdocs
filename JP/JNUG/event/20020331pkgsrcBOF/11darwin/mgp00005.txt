Can't compile c++ applications (PR 15651)
CXX definition in mk/sys.mk is wrong. It will be fixed in next release of the bootstrap kit.
  
libtool
Stable, development, pkgsrc and Apple version of libtool may not support Darwin completely. Fink has the patch for libtool 1.3.5.

dlcompat
Darwin doesn't have dlopen() and we need a wrapper emulate to it. Eric Gillespie ported Fink's dlcompat to pkgsrc, but we haven't commited it yet.
