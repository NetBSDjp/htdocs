pkgsrc BOF

Part I   Zoularis - pkgsrc for non-NetBSD systems -

* pkgsrc on MacOS X		Yamano-san
	-> Those with data

	300 pkgsrc can be compiled without any changes.
	Point of problems
		sys.mk is not suitable.
		libtool is brought from Fink.
		fetch dlopen.
		cpp included is by Apple. 
			-> Use cpp of gcc instead.
		Default cpp is compliant with precompiled header of Apple.

		By Shiroyama San, GNU cpp may be used if we use /usr/include only
		in place of default header files. Those Apple stuff precompiled 
		is a legacy of NeXT-inherited stuff.
		
		Also by Shiroyama San, there may be a name space problem in function.
		When the function with the same name is written to replace the
		existing one, the original one still be used instead of the replacement.
		
		It is said this may be controlled by the option of ld.

		The command line options of ld and strip are incompatible.
		HFS+ filesystem is case insensitive.
		Naming convention of shared library is different.
			-> bsd.pkg.mk
	Seemingly, agc will do its best towards 1.6.

* pkgsrc on Solaris		Haraoka-san
	-> Those with data

Advantage
		Management cost can lowered using pkgsrc.
		To ease installation for source-only-distribution.
		Solaris native pkg can be made of gensolpkg.
			-> It may be a problem it installs all when 'make package' is issued.

	Problems
		It is managed and distasteful in a package for solaris and duplication.
		Although compile is troublesome, since there is binary kit in zoularis, it is good.

	Ambition
		Supporting others also like Solaris8, AIX true64, BSD/OS, etc.
		It plunges into NSUG CD-ROM.

	Subjects
		should carry out OS dependence/non-depending consideration of the patch etc.

* pkgsrc on Linux		Sakamoto-san
	binary kit is old. Red Hat Package is object for 5.2, 6.0.

	NetBSD src tree is required to compile othersrc/zoularis.
restricted.
	Prerequisite stuff is not so many, but it is not available.

	Zoularis itself is not updated recently, some system-calls and lchown are not included

	mtree does not work correctly.

	Probably, it will be good to use bmake as default MAKE, or 
	prepare patches for FreeWnn to use BSD make.

	To be natural, Linux specific patches are not applied.

	It is not well-understood which versions of RPM packages are required.

	Linux native package can not be utilized in the context of pkgsrc, 
	although it may be out-of-scope.
	The work arround may be putting 
	.if exists(/usr/bin/pax) into each pkg.

	Who is the user ?

* Package system of Mac OS X	Shiroyama-san
	-> Those with data

	NeXT originated packges are not supported in MacOS X.
	The Darwin developer will use OpenPackages.
		-> Is there any info on development status ?
	        Doesn't seem proceeding  as a matter of fact.

	Other packages
		EasyPackage
			Development ended. (continuation by the author is not performed)
			It was comparatively popular by the Japanese author in Japan.
		PineApple
			rpm base
		Fink
			debian base
		GNU-Darwin
			FreeBSD ports base
			The whole distribution including Darwin which is Core OS is called GNU-Darwin.   There is no name of the package system itself.   It is sold at Plathome(Akihabara's shop).
			Requiring special attention, since openssh is overwritten at the time of installation of a package system. (This disables the operation  of ON/OF ssh from GUI.)

	The UNIX approaches (Terminal.app etc.) of Mac OS X may not be popular.
	The most of the users are interested in using classic environment for MacOS 9
	for their existing job.
	But it is true the new age who uses command line manupilation appears.

	If you install Darwin 1.4.1, it will be noticed Darwin itself relies on dpkg,
	which is based on .deb package.

* make packages on Darwin		OGATA
	-> Those with data

	iBook G3 500MHz
	HFS+
	MacOS X 10.1.3

	The command of a basic system is replaced. tar etc.

	7 days 10 hours

	distfiles 4.6GB

	317/2700 11% compile is possible.

* enabling IPv6 in MacOS X		OGATA
	-> Those with data

	Introduction as a use example of pkgsrc.
	Original is http://www.kame.net/newsletter/20020322/ .
	Pkgsrc is used for the library from BIND8, and openssh creation.
	re-build kernel
	re-build library
	use library,pkgsrc of KAME too



Part II   Whole pkgsrc

All the migration from a.out to elf will be completed when Mac68k work is done.
In pkgsrc, although an elf requred and Mac OS X are not with elf (Mach-O), elf migration
makes everybody happy. 
There may be 64 bit and endian issue, but it is just a matter how each software supports
and pkgsrc itself are not affected by these problem.

Linux emul, FreeBSD emul, and Win32 (PEACE) won't have any specific problems.
An emulation is possible if compat_darwin is prepared.?

good point
	Easy rather than doing ./configure one by one.
bad point
	Time consuming effort. Manuall installation is faster than preparing pkgsrc.
	Any slight Library update may makes whole dependent pkgsrc's to update.

make print-PLIST: PLIST creation command
	It does in this way:
	make install
	make print-PLIST > /tmp/PLIST
	It searches and PLIST is displayed by ${FIND} ${PREFIX}/. -newer ${EXTRACT_COOKIE}
	Seemingly, substitution of a fundamental environment variable will also be performed.

	It is more good to also use mount_union together.
	mount_union /a/pkg /usr/pkg
	(cd /usr/pkgsrc/foo/bar; make install)
	find /a/pkg -type f -or -type l > /tmp/plist2
	(cd /usr/pkgsrc/foo/bar; make deinstall)
	umount /usr/pkg

make tarup: It makes tarball and update.
	It is equivalent to 'pkg_tarup package-name'
	This procedure, not being perfect, make binary package from an installed package.
	make replace 
	will call this make target.
