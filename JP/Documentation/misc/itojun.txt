Subject: In Memoriam of Itojun
Message-ID: <20071102144604.GA20933@homeworld>


Jun-Ichiro itojun Hagino joined the NetBSD project in June of 1999. In
the eight years since that time, he contributed many hours to the
betterment of the project.

In addition to his work on the KAME project, which provided NetBSD's
IPv6 and IPsec support, Itojun also participated as a member of the Core
Group, which leads the development of NetBSD by making technical design
decisions. Itojun also contributed as a member of the Security-Officer
team.

Due to Itojun's efforts, NetBSD was the first open source operating
system with a production ready IPv6 networking stack, which was included
in the base system before many people knew what IPv6 was.

Those of us who had the pleasure of meeting him in person enjoyed his
demeanor and company, and his absence will be noted by all.
