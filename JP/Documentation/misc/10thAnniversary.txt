The NetBSD Project celebrates its 10th anniversary!

The Internet, March 21 -- This week marks the tenth anniversary of the
beginning of development of the NetBSD Operating System, one of the
oldest actively maintained, freely-available operating systems.
NetBSD runs on everything from embedded systems to desktop
workstations, from handhelds to big-iron servers, and is developed by
the NetBSD Project (http://www.netbsd.org/), one of the first Open
Source projects.

The first commits were made to the NetBSD source code repository on
March 21, 1993, and the first release of the NetBSD Operating System,
NetBSD 0.8, was announced on USENET shortly thereafter.  Throughout
the past ten years, NetBSD has increased the portability and security
of the 4BSD operating system on which NetBSD was based, and added
support for new processor and system families, while enhancing the
system's performance.  Following NetBSD 0.8, eight major and numerous
maintenance releases of NetBSD have been produced, and NetBSD has
become known as the most portable operating system in the world.

NetBSD 1.6, the latest release, includes support for most major
current processor architectures, including x86, Alpha, SPARC, ARM,
M68K, MIPS, PowerPC, and SH, as well as several legacy processor
architectures.  It supports 39 different system architectures.

The next major release, NetBSD 2.0, will continue the tradition of the
last ten years by providing additional features and hardware support
while maintaining the stability and performance that users have come
to expect from NetBSD.  NetBSD 2.0 will include support for x86-64
processors and will provide native threads based on Scheduler
Activations.  It will support over fifty system architectures,
including support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) on x86, Alpha,
and SPARC systems, on PowerPC-based Macintoshes, and even on VAXen.

Code from NetBSD has been included in countless other projects, Open
Source and otherwise.  It has been used in research and education as
well as in commercial products.  Literally thousands of third-party
applications have been made available for use under NetBSD through the
use of ``pkgsrc,'' the NetBSD Packages Collection.  Keeping with
NetBSD's goal of portability, pkgsrc also supports several other
operating systems, thereby allowing consistent installation and
management of third-party software across multiple platforms.

In honor of the momentous event of NetBSD's 10th birthday, many of the
nearly 200 active NetBSD developers are holding public regional
gatherings to celebrate with fellow developers, NetBSD users, and
interested members of the public.
