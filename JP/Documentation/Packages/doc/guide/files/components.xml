  <title>Package components - files, directories and contents</title>
  
  <para>  Whenever you're preparing a package, there are a number of
    files involved which are described in the following
    sections. </para> 

  <sect1 id="components.Makefile">
    <title><filename>Makefile</filename></title>

    <para>Building, installation and creation of a binary package are all
      controlled by the package's <filename>Makefile</filename>.
      The <filename>Makefile</filename> describes various things about
      a package, for example from where to get it, how to configure,
      build, and install it.
    </para>

    <para>A package <filename>Makefile</filename> contains several
     sections that describe the package.</para>

    <para>In the first section there are the following variables, which
      should appear exactly in the order given here.
      <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><varname>DISTNAME</varname> is the basename of the
      distribution file to be downloaded from the package's
      website.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><varname>PKGNAME</varname> is the name of the
      package, as used by pkgsrc. You only need to provide it if it
      differs from DISTNAME. Usually it is the directory name together
      with the version number. It must match the regular expression
      <varname>^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9-_.+]*$</varname>, that is, it
      starts with a letter or digit, and contains only letters, digits,
      dashes, underscores, dots and plus signs.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><varname>CATEGORIES</varname> is a list of categories
	    which the package fits in. You can choose any of the top-level
	    directories of pkgsrc for it.</para>

	<para>Currently the following values are available for
	  <varname>CATEGORIES</varname>. If more than
	  one is used, they need to be separated by spaces:</para>

	<programlisting>
archivers     cross         geography     meta-pkgs     security
audio         databases     graphics      misc          shells
benchmarks    devel         ham           multimedia    sysutils
biology       editors       inputmethod   net           textproc
cad           emulators     lang          news          time
chat          finance       mail          parallel      wm
comms         fonts         math          pkgtools      www
converters    games         mbone         print         x11</programlisting>
	</listitem>

	<listitem><para><varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> is a list of URLs where
	    the distribution files can be downloaded. Each URL must end with a
	    slash.</para>
	  <para>The <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> may make use of
	    the following predefined sites:</para>

<!-- sort bsd.sites.mk | sed -n 's/\(^MA[A-Z_]*\).*/        ${\1}/p' -->
	  <programlisting>
	    ${MASTER_SITE_APACHE}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_BACKUP}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_CYGWIN}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_DEBIAN}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_FREEBSD}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_FREEBSD_LOCAL}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_GNOME}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_GNU}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_GNUSTEP}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_IFARCHIVE}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_MOZILLA}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_OPENOFFICE}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_PERL_CPAN}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_R_CRAN}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_SUNSITE}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_SUSE}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_TEX_CTAN}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_XCONTRIB}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_XEMACS}
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>If one of these predefined sites is chosen, you may
	    want to specify a subdirectory of that
	    site.  Since these macros may expand to more than one
	    actual site, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> use the
	    following construct to specify a subdirectory:</para>

	  <programlisting>
	    ${MASTER_SITE_GNU:=subdirectory/name/}
	    ${MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE:=project_name/}</programlisting>

	  <para>Note the trailing slash after the subdirectory name.</para>

	  <para>If the package has multiple
	    <varname>DISTFILES</varname> or multiple
	    <varname>PATCHFILES</varname> from different
	    sites, set <varname>SITES_foo</varname> to a list of URI's
	    where file <quote>foo</quote> may be
	    found. <quote>foo</quote> includes the suffix, e.g.</para>
	  <programlisting>DISTFILES=      ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}
DISTFILES+=     foo-file.tar.gz
SITES_foo-file.tar.gz=http://www.somewhere.com/somehow/ \
        http://www.somewhereelse.com/mirror/somehow/</programlisting>
	</listitem>

	<listitem><para><varname>DISTFILES</varname>: Name(s)
	    of archive file(s) containing distribution. The default is
	    <filename>${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}</filename>. Should only
	    be set if you have more than one distfile.</para>
	  <para>Note that the normal default setting of
	    <varname>DISTFILES</varname> must be made explicit if you
	    want to add to it (rather than replace it), as you usually
	    would.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem><para><varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname>: Suffix of the
	    distribution file, will be appended to
	    <varname>DISTNAME</varname>. Defaults to
	    <filename>.tar.gz</filename>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>The second section contains information about separately
      downloaded patches, if any.
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><varname>PATCHFILES</varname>
	  Name(s) of additional files that contain distribution patches.
	  There is no default. pkgsrc will look for them at
	  <varname>PATCH_SITES</varname>.
	  They will automatically be uncompressed before patching if
	  the names end with <filename>.gz</filename> or
	  <filename>.Z</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para><varname>PATCH_SITES</varname>:
	  Primary location(s) for distribution patch files (see
	  <varname>PATCHFILES</varname> below) if not found locally.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>The third section contains the following variables.
      <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><varname>MAINTAINER</varname> is the email address of the
	    contact person for this package.
	    The person who feels responsible for this package, and who is most
	    likely to look at problems or questions regarding this package
	    which have been reported with &man.send-pr.1;. The right
	    person to contact before making major changes to the
	    package.
	    When packaging a new program, set
	    <varname>MAINTAINER</varname> to yourself.  If you really
	    can't maintain the package for future updates, set it to
	    <email>tech-pkg@NetBSD.org</email>.</para> 
	</listitem>

      <listitem><para><varname>HOMEPAGE</varname> is a URL where users can
      find more information about the package.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><varname>COMMENT</varname> is a one-line
      description of the package (should not include the package
      name).</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>Other variables that affect the build:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><varname>WRKSRC</varname>:
	    The subdirectory of <filename>${WRKDIR}</filename> to which
	    the distribution actually unpacks. The default is
	    <filename>${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}</filename>.
	    The value of <varname>WRKSRC</varname> should be set
	    explicitly if the package does not follow standard
	    conventions and include the package's name as a
	    subdirectory.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>Please pay attention to the following gotchas:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Add <varname>MANCOMPRESSED</varname> if manpages are installed in
          compressed form by the package; see comment in
          <filename>bsd.pkg.mk</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Replace <filename>/usr/local</filename> with
          <quote>${PREFIX}</quote> in all files (see patches, below).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the package installs any info files, see
          <xref linkend="faq.info-files"/>.</para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="components.distinfo">
    <title><filename>distinfo</filename></title>

    <para>Most important, the mandatory message digest, or checksum, of all the
      distfiles needed for the package to compile, confirming they match the
      original file distributed by the author.  This ensures that the
      distfile retrieved from the Internet has not been corrupted during
      transfer or altered by a malign force to introduce a security hole.
      It is generated using the <command>make makesum</command> command.
      The digest algorithm used was, at one stage, md5, but that was felt
      lacking compared to sha1, and so sha1 is now the default algorithm.
      The distfile size is also generated and stored in new distinfo files.
      The <filename role="pkg">pkgtools/digest</filename> utility 
      calculates all of the digests in the distinfo file, and it provides 
      various different algorithms.  At the current time, the algorithms 
      provided are:
      <emphasis>md5</emphasis>, <emphasis>rmd160</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>sha1</emphasis>, <emphasis>sha256</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>sha384</emphasis> and <emphasis>sha512</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Some packages have different sets of distfiles on a per architecture
      basis, for example <filename 
        role="pkg">www/navigator</filename>). These are kept in the
      same distinfo file and care should be taken when upgrading such a
      package to ensure distfile information is not lost.</para>

    <para>The message digest/checksum for all the official patches found in the
      <filename>patches/</filename> directory (see
      <xref linkend="components.patches"/>) for the package is also stored in
      the <filename>distinfo</filename> file. This is a message
      digest/checksum of all lines in the patch file except the &os; RCS Id.
      This file is generated by invoking <command>make
      makepatchsum</command> (or <command>make mps</command> if you're
      in a hurry).</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="components.patches">
    <title>patches/*</title>

    <para>This directory contains files that are used by the
      &man.patch.1; command to
      modify the sources as distributed in the distribution file into a form
      that will compile and run perfectly on &os;. The files are applied
      successively in alphabetic order (as returned by a shell
      <quote>patches/patch-*</quote> glob expansion), so
      <filename>patch-aa</filename> is applied before
      <filename>patch-ab</filename>, etc.</para>

    <para>The <filename>patch-*</filename> files should be in
      <command>diff -bu</command> format, and apply without a fuzz to avoid
      problems. (To force patches to apply
      with fuzz you can set <varname>PATCH_FUZZ_FACTOR=-F2</varname>).
      Furthermore, do not put changes for more than one file into a single
      patch-file, as this will make future modifications more difficult.</para>

    <para>Similar, a file should be patched at most once, not several times by
      several different patches. If a file needs several patches, they should
      be combined into one file.</para>

    <para>One important thing to mention is to pay attention that no RCS IDs
      get stored in the patch files, as these will cause problems when
      later checked into the &os; CVS tree. Use the
      <command>pkgdiff</command> from the 
      <filename role="pkg">pkgtools/pkgdiff</filename> package to avoid 
      these problems.</para>

    <para>For even more automation, we recommend using <command>mkpatches</command> from the same
      package to make a whole set of patches. You just have to backup files
      before you edit them to <filename>filename.orig</filename>, e.g. with
      <command>cp -p filename filename.orig</command> or, easier, by using
      <command>pkgvi</command> again from the same package. If you upgrade a package
      this way, you can easily compare the new set of patches with the
      previously existing one with <command>patchdiff</command>.</para>

    <para>When you have finished a package, remember to generate the checksums
      for the patch files by using the <command>make makepatchsum</command>
      command, see <xref linkend="components.distinfo"/>.</para>

    <para>Patch files that are distributed by the author or other
      maintainers can be listed in
      <varname>$PATCHFILES</varname>. </para> 
    
    <para>If it is desired to store any patches that should not be committed into
      pkgsrc, they can be kept outside the pkgsrc tree in the
      <filename>$LOCALPATCHES</filename>
      directory. The directory tree there is expected to have the same
      <quote>category/package</quote> structure as pkgsrc, and patches are
      expected to be stored inside these dirs (also known as
      <filename>$LOCALPATCHES/$PKGPATH</filename>). For
      example if you want to keep a private patch for
      <filename>pkgsrc/graphics/png</filename>, keep
      it in <filename>$LOCALPATCHES/graphics/png/mypatch</filename>. All
      files in the named directory are expected to be patch files, and
      <emphasis>they are applied after pkgsrc patches are applied</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>When you type <command>make</command> the distribution files are
      unpacked into the directory denoted by
      <varname>WRKDIR</varname>. It can be removed by running
      <command>make clean</command>. Besides the sources, this
      directory is also used to keep various timestamp files.
      The directory gets <emphasis>removed completely</emphasis> on clean.
      The default is <filename>${.CURDIR}/work</filename>
      or <filename>${.CURDIR}/work.${MACHINE_ARCH}</filename>
      if <varname>OBJMACHINE</varname> is set.</para>

    <para> If a package doesn't create a subdirectory for itself (like
      GNU software does, for instance), but extracts itself in the
      current directory, you should set <varname>WRKSRC</varname>
      accordingly, e.g. <filename role="pkg">editors/sam</filename> 
      again, but the quick answer is:</para>

    <programlisting>WRKSRC=             ${WRKDIR}</programlisting>

    <para>If a package doesn't create a subdir with the name of
      <varname>DISTNAME</varname> but some different name, set
      <varname>WRKSRC</varname> to point to the proper name in
      <filename>${WRKDIR}</filename>. See <filename 
        role="pkg">lang/tcl</filename> and
      <filename role="pkg">x11/tk</filename> for examples, and here is 
      another one: </para>
      
    <programlisting>WRKSRC=         ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}/unix</programlisting>

    <para> The name of the working directory created by pkgsrc is
      <filename>work</filename> by default. If the same pkgsrc tree
      should be used on several different platforms, the variable
      <varname>OBJMACHINE</varname> can be set in /etc/mk.conf to
      attach the platform to the directory name,
      e.g. <filename>work.i386</filename> or
      <filename>work.sparc</filename>. </para>

  <sect1 id="files-dir">
    <title><filename>files/*</filename></title>

    <para>If you have any files that you wish to be placed in the package prior
      to configuration or building, you could place these files here and use
      a <quote>${CP}</quote> command in the
      <quote>pre-configure</quote> target to achieve 
      this. Alternatively, you could simply diff the file against
      <filename>/dev/null</filename> and use the patch mechanism to manage
      the creation of this file.</para>
