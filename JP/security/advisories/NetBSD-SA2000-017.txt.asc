                 NetBSD Security Advisory 2000-017
                 =================================

Topic:		Exploitable bugs in kerberised telnetd and libkrb
Version:	1.5
Severity:	local root compromise possible
Fixed:		2000/12/09 in -current; 2000/12/15 in netbsd-1-5-branch

Abstract
========

The combination of a too liberal implementation in telnetd and bugs in
libkrb combines to make it possible for authorized users of a system
to obtain root access on a system.

Technical Details
=================

there were two problems; first, telnetd allowed the user to provide
arbitrary environment variables, including several that cause programs
to behave differently.  There was also a possible buffer overflow in
the kerberos v4 library.

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

The problem was fixed in NetBSD-current on 2000/12/09; systems running
NetBSD-current dated from before that date should be upgraded to
NetBSD-current dated 2000/12/09 or later.  The 1.5 branch was
fixed by 2000/12/15.

Systems running 1.4.x are not vulnerable to this problem as they do
not contain this version of kerberos.

Systems running 1.5 should apply the patch found in
    ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/misc/security/patches/20001220-krb
and then rebuild and reinstall both the "libkrb" library and telnetd.

Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2000/12/09 should be
upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2000/12/09 or later.
