Technical Details

http://www.sendmail.org/smrsh.adv.txt


Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

If your system uses smrsh, your system is vulnerable.
If you see lines matching "smrsh" in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf, you are using
smrsh.

	% grep smrsh /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

Even if you are not using smrsh, we encourage you to upgrade smrsh binary.

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your smrsh
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of smrsh.

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2002-10-04
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2002-10-04 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		gnu/dist/sendmail/smrsh

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install smrsh:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P gnu/dist/sendmail/smrsh

		# cd gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail/smrsh
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.6:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.6 dated from before 2002-10-04
	should be upgraded to NetBSD 1.6 dated 2002-10-04 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		gnu/dist/sendmail/smrsh

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install smrsh:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P gnu/dist/sendmail/smrsh

		# cd gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail/smrsh
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5 dated from before 2002-10-04
	should be upgraded to NetBSD 1.5 dated 2002-10-04 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		gnu/dist/sendmail/smrsh

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install smrsh:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P gnu/dist/sendmail/smrsh

		# cd gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail/smrsh
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
