Abstract
========


Block cipher padding errors and MAC verification errors were handled
differently in the SSL/TLS parts of the OpenSSL library.  This
leaks information in the case of incorrect SSL streams and allows
for an adaptive timing attack.

No services using SSL/TLS are enabled by default in NetBSD, however, by
enabling services built with these libraries, a system could become
vulnerable to the compromise of cryptographic keys.

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your libssl
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and installing
a new version of libssl.

Be sure to restart running instances of programs that use the libssl
library after upgrading.

If you have any statically-linked binaries that linked against a
vulnerable libssl, you need to recompile them.


* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2003-02-21
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2003-02-21 or later.

	The following file needs to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_pkt.c

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libssl:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_pkt.c
		# cd lib/libssl
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install


* NetBSD 1.6:

	Upgrading to the soon-to-be-released 1.6.1 is recommended.

	If a source-based point upgrade is required, sources from the
	NetBSD 1.6 branch dated 2003-02-21 or later should be used.

	The following file needs to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_pkt.c

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libssl:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 \
			crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_pkt.c 
		# cd lib/libssl
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install


* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	Systems running NetBSD-1.5.x dated from before 2003-02-27
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-1.5 branch dated 2003-02-27 or later.

	The following file needs to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_pkt.c

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libssl:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 \
			crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_pkt.c 
		# cd lib/libssl
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.4, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3:

	OpenSSL was not included in the base system in NetBSD-1.4.*
	Follow the directions for pkgsrc if you have installed it from
	pkgsrc.


* pkgsrc:

	openssl (pkgsrc/security/openssl) prior to 0.9.6gnb1 are
	vulnerable.  Upgrade to openssl-0.9.6gnb1 or later; pkgsrc
	currently contains 0.9.6gnb1 at time of this writing.

	Packages which require openssl can be found by running 'pkg_info
	openssl'. Depending on the method you choose to update pkgsrc
	packages, a rebuild of the packages on that list may be
	performed for you by the package system. If you update using the
	experimental 'make replace' target, you will need to manually
	update any packages which build static binaries with libssl.a.

        If you have statically linked binaries in pkgsrc, they have to be
        rebuilt.  Statically linked binaries can be identified by the
        following command (note: be sure to include the directory you install
        pkgsrc binaries to, if you've changed LOCALBASE from the default of
        /usr/pkg)

                file /usr/pkg/{bin,sbin,libexec}/* | grep static
