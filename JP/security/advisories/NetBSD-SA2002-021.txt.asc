Abstract
========

There are several buffer overflows in the processing of saved games
when restarting rogue(6), that allow one to obtain group "games."


Technical Details
=================

When rogue(6) saves a game for later, it writes a string length with
each string in the save file.  When re-reading the file for continuing
the game, this value was used unbounded when reading the string,
allowing a hand-crafted save file to overflow a buffer.

All read operations from the save file are now correctly bounded.


Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

The easiest solution to this problem is to simply remove the set-gid
bit from rogue(6):

	# chmod g-s /usr/games/rogue

This only impacts rogue's ability to save scores.


The following instructions describe how to upgrade your rogue(6)
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of rogue(6).

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2002-10-02
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2002-10-02 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		games/rogue

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install rogue(6):
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P games/rogue
		# cd games/rogue

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.6:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.6 sources dated from before
	2002-10-03 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.6 sources dated
	2002-10-03 or later.

	NetBSD 1.6.1 will include the fix.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		games/rogue

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install rogue(6):

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 games/rogue
		# cd games/rogue

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


	Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
	differences):
		ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2002-021-rogue.patch

	To patch, re-build and re-install rogue(6):

		# cd src/games/rogue
		# patch < /path/to/SA20020-021-rogue.patch

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, or 1.5.3 sources dated
	from before 2002-10-03 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.*
	sources dated 2002-10-03 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		games/rogue

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install rogue(6):

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 games/rogue
		# cd games/rogue

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


	Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
	differences):
		ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2002-021-rogue.patch

	To patch, re-build and re-install rogue(6):

		# cd src/games/rogue
		# patch < /path/to/SA20020-021-rogue.patch

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
