Abstract
========

NetBSD's ftpd responds to the STAT command in a way that is not
standards conformant, when a filename that contains "\n[0-9]" is
specified.  This could be used by a malicious party to corrupt state
tables in firewall devices between an FTP client and a NetBSD FTP
server.


Technical Details
=================

According to RFC959 (page 36), if a non-response digit appears in an
FTP control stream, it must be escaped by inserting a space before it.
NetBSD's ftpd did not obey this requirement.

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

Upgrading libexec/ftpd is required to eliminate this problem.

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your ftpd
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of ftpd.

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2002-10-26
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2002-10-26 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		libexec/ftpd

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install ftpd:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P libexec/ftpd
		# cd libexec/ftpd

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.6:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.6 sources dated from before 2002-11-02 should
	be upgraded from NetBSD 1.6.* sources dated 2002-11-02 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		libexec/ftpd

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install ftpd:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 libexec/ftpd
		# cd libexec/ftpd

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, or 1.5.3 sources dated
	from before 2002-10-26 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.*
	sources dated 2002-10-26 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		libexec/ftpd

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install ftpd:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 libexec/ftpd
		# cd libexec/ftpd

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
