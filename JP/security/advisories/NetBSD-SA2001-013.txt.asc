                 NetBSD Security Advisory 2001-013
                 =================================

Topic:		OpenSSL PRNG weakness (up to 0.9.6a)

Version:	NetBSD-current:	source prior to July 10, 2001
		NetBSD 1.5.1:	affected
		NetBSD 1.5:	affected
		pkgsrc:		OpenSSL packages prior to 0.9.6b or 0.9.6nb1

Severity:	attacker can predict sequence of future PRNG outputs

Fixed:		NetBSD-current:		July 10, 2001
		NetBSD-1.5 branch:	July 29, 2001 (1.5.2 includes the fix)
		pkgsrc:			openssl-0.9.6b or openssl-0.9.6nb1

Abstract
========

The OpenSSL libcrypto includes a PRNG (pseudo random number generator)
implementation.  The logic used for PRNG was not strong enough,
and allows attackers to guess the internal state of the PRNG.
Therefore, attackers can predict future PRNG output.


Technical Details
=================

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

The problem can be remedied by replacing the libcrypto library,
and recompiling all statically-linked binaries on the system that
use this library.

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your OpenSSL
libraries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and installing
a new version of the OpenSSL libraries.


* All NetBSD releases using OpenSSL from pkgsrc:

	If you are using OpenSSL from pkgsrc, upgrade it to either of
	the following packages:
		openssl-0.9.6b or higher
		openssl-0.9.6nb1 (0.9.6 + specific fix for the issue)

	Also, make sure that you upgrade any statically-linked binaries
	in packages and local applications that have been linked with
	libcrypto.


* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2001-07-10
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2001-07-11 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		src/crypto/dist/openssl
		src/lib/libcrypto

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install the OpenSSL
	libraries:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P crypto/dist/openssl lib/libcrypto
		# cd lib/libcrypto
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install

	You also need to upgrade any statically-linked binaries
	that use libcrypto.  Whilst there are no statically-linked
	binaries in the default NetBSD installation that use
	libcrypto, it would be a good idea to run a full build
	(i.e. "make build").


* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5 or 1.5.1 sources dated from
	before 2001-07-29 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.x
	sources dated 2001-07-30 or later.

	NetBSD 1.5.2 is not vulnerable.

	The following source needs to be updated to version 1.2
	or later from the netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		crypto/dist/openssl/crypto/rand/md_rand.c

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install the OpenSSL
	libraries:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P crypto/dist/openssl/crypto/rand
		# cd lib/libcrypto
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


        Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
        differences):
                ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2001-013-openssl-1.5.patch

	To patch, re-build and re-install the OpenSSL libraries:
		# cd src/crypto/dist/openssl/crypto/rand
		# patch < /path/to/SA2001-013-openssl-1.5.patch
		# cd ../../../../../lib/libcrypto
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


	You also need to upgrade any statically-linked binaries
	that use libcrypto.  Whilst there are no statically-linked
	binaries in the default NetBSD installation that use
	libcrypto, it would be a good idea to run a full build
	(i.e. "make build").


Thanks To

Jun-ichiro Hagino for the fix to -current and 1.5

Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen for discovering the problem
in the PRNG and reporting it to the OpenSSL project.
