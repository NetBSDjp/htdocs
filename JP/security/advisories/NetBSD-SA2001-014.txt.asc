                 NetBSD Security Advisory 2001-014
                 =================================

Topic:		dump(8) exposes 'tty' group 

Version:	NetBSD-current: source prior to August 8, 2001
		NetBSD 1.5.1:	affected
		NetBSD 1.5:	affected
		NetBSD 1.4.x:	all affected
		
Severity:	local users can gain tty group

Fixed:		NetBSD-current:		August 8, 2001
		NetBSD-1.5 branch:	August 8, 2001 (1.5.2 includes the fix)
		NetBSD-1.4 branch:	Pullups pending - apply the patch as
					explained below.


Abstract
========

The dump(8) command (installed as /sbin/dump) and the dump_lfs(8)
command (installed as /sbin/dump_lfs) are setgid tty.  dump(8) and
dump_lfs(8) did not drop those setgid tty rights while performing
functions other than those the rights were provided for, including
execution of a user supplied RCMD_CMD environment variable.


Technical Details
=================

dump(8) and dump_lfs(8) require tty rights in order to notify
members of the operator group to change backup media.  Since a user
can supply an executable as a method to access a remote dump device
by setting the RCMD_CMD environment variable, a local user can gain
tty privilieges for themselves.

With the supplied patch, dump(8) and dump_lfs(8) properly reserve
tty rights and activate them only for the intended use.


Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your dump(8)
and dump_lfs(8) binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding
and installing a new version of dump(8) and dump_lfs(8).

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2001-08-08
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2001-08-09 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		basesrc/sbin/dump

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install dump and dump_lfs:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P sbin/dump
		# cd sbin/dump

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
		# cd ../dump_lfs
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5 or 1.5.1 sources dated from
	before 2001-08-08 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.x
	sources dated 2001-08-09 or later.

	NetBSD 1.5.2 is not vulnerable.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		src/sbin/dump

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install dump and dump_lfs:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P sbin/dump
		# cd sbin/dump

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
		# cd ../dump_lfs
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


	Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
	differences):
		ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2001-014-dump-1.5.patch

	To patch, re-build and re-install dump and dump_lfs:

		# cd src/sbin/dump
		# patch < /path/to/SA2001-014-dump-1.5.patch

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
		# cd ../dump_lfs
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.4, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3:

	The patch supplied for the 1.5 releases, also applies to
	1.4, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3.

	Follow the instructions for using the patch as detailed in
	the NetBSD 1.5 section above.
