The problem could be remotely exploited depending on lpd(8) setup.


Technical Details
=================

http://online.securityfocus.com/bid/3103


Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

If you enable remote printing via lpd(8), the problem is remotely
exploitable, and therefore severity is high.  Even if you do not
run remote printing via lpd(8), we encourage you to upgrade pic(1) binary
to prevent opening up security hole with future reconfiguration.

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your pic
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of pic.

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2002-09-28
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2002-09-28 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		gnu/dist/groff/src/preproc/pic

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install pic:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P gnu/dist/groff/src/preproc/pic

		# cd gnu/usr.bin/groff/pic
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.6:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.6 beta sources dated from before
	2002-10-03 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.6 sources dated
	2002-10-03 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		gnu/dist/groff/src/preproc/pic

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install pic:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 gnu/dist/groff/src/preproc/pic

		# cd gnu/usr.bin/groff/pic
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, or 1.5.3 sources dated
	from before 2002-09-28 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.*
	sources dated 2002-09-28 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		gnu/usr.bin/groff/pic

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install pic:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 gnu/usr.bin/groff/pic

		# cd gnu/usr.bin/groff/pic
