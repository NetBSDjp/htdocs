		 NetBSD Security Advisory 2002-025
		 =================================

Topic:		trek(6) buffer overrun

Version:	NetBSD-current:	source prior to October 19, 2002
		NetBSD 1.6:	affected (no real harm)
		NetBSD-1.5.3:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5.2:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5.1:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5:	affected

Severity:	Local user can elevate privileges to group "games"

Fixed:		NetBSD-current:		October 19, 2002
		NetBSD-1.6 branch:	October 22, 2002
		NetBSD-1.5 branch:	October 19, 2002


Abstract
========

There is a buffer overflow in the processing of keyboard input by trek(6).

On NetBSD 1.5 and prior, trek(6) is executed via dm(8), so a malicious
local user could elevate privilege to group "games".

On NetBSD 1.6 and NetBSD-current systems, trek(6) will terminate if
the input is too long.


Technical Details
=================

When trek(6) reads in keyboard input, a bounds check was not performed
correctly.  If more than 100 characters are entered, a buffer overrun
occurs.


Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

For NetBSD 1.5 systems, the easiest solution is to stop providing trek(6)
to users:
	# rm /usr/games/trek
	# rm /usr/games/hide/trek

NetBSD 1.6 and -current do not use dm(8) for executing trek(6), so no
real harm will be done - the trek program executes only with the
user's existing privileges.


The following instructions describe how to upgrade your trek(6)
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of trek(6).

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2002-10-19
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2002-10-19 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		games/trek

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install trek(6):
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P games/trek
		# cd games/trek

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.6:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.6 sources dated from before
	2002-10-22 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.6 sources dated
	2002-10-22 or later.

	NetBSD 1.6.1 will include the fix.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		games/trek

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install trek(6):

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 games/trek
		# cd games/trek

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install


* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, or 1.5.3 sources dated
	from before 2002-10-19 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.*
	sources dated 2002-10-19 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		games/trek

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install trek(6):

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 games/trek
		# cd games/trek

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
