                 NetBSD Security Advisory 2001-018
                 =================================

Topic:		Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in BSD Line Printer Daemon

Version:	NetBSD-current: prior to August 28, 2001
		NetBSD-1.5.2:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5.1:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5:	affected
		NetBSD-1.4.*:	affected

Severity:	Remote root compromise from any host which can connect to lpd(8)

Fixed:		NetBSD-current:		August 28, 2001
		NetBSD-1.5 branch:	September 30, 2001
		NetBSD-1.4 branch: 	not yet

Abstract
========

There is an remotely exploitable buffer overrun in the printer daemon,
/usr/sbin/lpd.


Technical Details
=================

http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/bugtraq0108/259.html


Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

NetBSD 1.3 and later install with lpd disabled by default.  A system is
vulnerable to this security hole only if it is running /usr/sbin/lpd,
and access to lpd is allowed by entries in /etc/hosts.lpd.  Updating
the binary for safety is recommended.

Quick workaround:
If you are running /usr/sbin/lpd, and you do not need it, stop it.
If you have /etc/hosts.lpd which is open to everyone, you will want to
tighten the setup so that no malicious parties can access your remote printer.

Solutions:

* NetBSD -current, 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2001-08-28
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2001-08-28 or later.

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1 or 1.5.2 dated from before
	2001-09-30 should be upgraded to NetBSD-1.5 branch sources dated
	2001-09-30 or later.

	The following directory needs to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD) for NetBSD-current,
	or netbsd-1-5 CVS branch for NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1 or 1.5.2:
		src/usr.sbin/lpr

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install lpd(8):
		# cd src/usr.sbin/lpr
		# cvs update -d -P
		# make cleandir dependall install


	Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
	differences) and rebuild & re-install lpd(8):
		ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2001-018-lpd.patch

	To patch, re-build and re-install lpd(8):
		# cd src/usr.sbin/lpr/common_sources
		# patch < /path/to/SA2001-012-lpd.patch
		# cd ../lpd
		# make cleandir dependall install


* NetBSD 1.4, 1.4.x:

	Systems running NetBSD-1.4.x releases should apply the following
	patch (with potential offset differences):
		ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2001-018-lpd.patch

	To patch, re-build and re-install lpd(8):
		# cd src/usr.sbin/lpr/common_sources
		# patch < /path/to/SA2001-012-lpd.patch
		# cd ../lpd
		# make cleandir dependall install


	The anonymous CVS branch netbsd-1-4 should be updated with a
	fix in the near future.
