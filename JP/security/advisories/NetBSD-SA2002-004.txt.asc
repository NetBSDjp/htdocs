Abstract
========

OpenSSH prior to version 3.1 has an off-by-one error in the channel code.

This bug can be exploited locally by an authenticated user
logging into a vulnerable OpenSSH server or remotely by a malicious
SSH server attacking a vulnerable OpenSSH client.

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

To identify if your binary is vulnerable, you can use "ssh -V" and "sshd -V"
command.

On NetBSD-current, the following version string identifies the fixed version.
If you see version string prior to this date, the binary is vulnerable.
	sshd version OpenSSH_3.1 NetBSD_Secure_Shell-20020308

On NetBSD 1.5 branch, the following string identifies the fixed version.
If you see version string prior to this date, the binary is vulnerable.
	sshd version OpenSSH_3.0.2 NetBSD_Secure_Shell-20020307

With pkgsrc, use pkg_info(1) to identify the version.  The following version
is not vulnerable.  Versions prior to this is vulnerable.
	openssh-3.0.2.1nb2

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2002-03-06
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2002-03-07 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		crypto/dist/ssh
		usr.bin/ssh

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install the ssh suite:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P crypto/dist/ssh usr.bin/ssh
		# cd usr.bin/ssh

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install

	Be sure to restart a running instance of ssh daemon (/usr/sbin/sshd).

* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2:

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1 or 1.5.2 sources dated from
	before 2002-03-06 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.*
	sources dated 2002-03-07 or later.

	NetBSD 1.5.3 will include the fix.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		crypto/dist/ssh
		usr.bin/ssh

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install the ssh suite:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P crypto/dist/ssh usr.bin/ssh
		# cd usr.bin/ssh

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install

	Be sure to restart a running instance of ssh daemon (/usr/sbin/sshd).

        Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
        differences):

                ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2002-004-sshd-1.5.patch

        To patch, re-build and re-install the ssh suite:

                # cd src/crypto/dist/ssh
                # patch < /path/to/SA2002-004-sshd-1.5.patch
		# cd ../../../usr.bin/ssh

                # make cleandir dependall
                # make install

	Be sure to restart a running instance of ssh daemon (/usr/sbin/sshd).

	Alternatively, you can install openssh newer than openssh-3.1.0.1
	from pkgsrc and use them instead. Be certain to remove the old executables
	in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin if you choose this method, so that the /usr/pkg/
	binaries will be used.

* pkgsrc

	OpenSSH pkgsrc prior to openssh-3.0.2.1nb2 must be upgraded to
	openssh-3.0.2.1nb2 or later.
