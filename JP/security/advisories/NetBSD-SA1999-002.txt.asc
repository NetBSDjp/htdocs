                 NetBSD Security Advisory 1999-002
                 =================================

Topic:		Security problem with netstat
Version:	NetBSD-current from 19980603 to 19990208.
Severity:	Local users are able to read any kernel memory
		location.


Abstract
========

In the version of netstat between the two dates above, a security hole
exists which will allow non-root users to examine any kernel memory
location.


Technical Details
=================

The code which was added to allow printing of kernel protocol control
blocks does not have strict checks to make certain the memory being
display is a protocol control block.  Also, since the block contains
information like TCP sequence numbers, users should generally not be
allowed to examine these blocks.

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

NetBSD-current users should update to a source tree newer than
19990208, or apply this patch and rebuild netstat:

    ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/misc/security/patches/19990208-netstat


If this action cannot be taken easily, netstat can be disabled for
non-root users.

	chmod 555 /usr/bin/netstat


Thanks To
=========

Thanks go to Michael Graff <explorer@netbsd.org> and Charles Hannum
