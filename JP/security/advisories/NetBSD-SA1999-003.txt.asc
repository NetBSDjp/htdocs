                 NetBSD Security Advisory 1999-003
                 =================================

Topic:		Security problems in wu-ftpd package fixed
Version:	Anything before wu-ftpd-2.4.2b18.2
Severity:	Remote buffer overflows in various FTP servers leads
		to potential root compromise. 


Abstract
========

Remote buffer overflows in various FTP servers leads to potential root
compromise. 


Technical Details
=================

When processing pathnames from commands such as CWD and MKD, the FTP
server realpath module would incorrectly copy beyond the end of it's
buffer.  This could happen if passed a length greater than MAXPATHLEN
(1024), or if the full real path (outside of ~ftp) was greater than
MAXPATHLEN.  This allowed a remote attack to compromise the system by
overwriting the programs stack with their own data, possibly gaining
root access.


Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

NetBSD users should update to a pkgsrc tree newer than 19990214
and make sure the version of their wu-ftpd package is at least
wu-ftpd-2.4.2b18.2. 

Binaries for NetBSD 1.3.3 and NetBSD-current are available at

	ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.3/
	ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.3.3/

and
	ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.3I/

respectively.


Thanks To
=========

Thanks go to Rene Hexel <rh@idle.trapdoor.vip.at> for updating the
wu-ftpd package with appropriate patches to fix all buffer overruns
and to Hubert Feyrer <hubert.feyrer@rz.uni-regensburg.de> for
coordinating package fixing, binary package builds and the
corresponding annoucements.
