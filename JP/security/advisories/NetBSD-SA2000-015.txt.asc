                 NetBSD Security Advisory 2000-015
                 =================================

Topic:		format-string bugs in passwd/libutil
Version:	all releases up to and including 1.4.2
Severity:	local root compromise possible
Fixed:		2000/10/03 in -current and netbsd-1-5 branches
		2000/10/04 in netbsd-1-4 branch.
		fix will be in the 1.4.3 and 1.5 releases

Abstract
========

The pw_error() function of the system libutil library, used by several
programs including the setuid passwd program, was vulnerable to a
format string attack.


Technical Details
=================

pw_error passed its first argument to the warn(3) function, which
interprets its first argument as a format string.  in certain
circumstances, passwd(1) passes a value derived from untrusted user
input to pw_error().


Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

The problem was fixed in NetBSD-current on 2000/10/03; systems running
NetBSD-current dated from before that date should be upgraded to
NetBSD-current dated 2000/10/04 or later.  The two active release
branches were both fixed by 2000/10/05.

Systems running releases older than NetBSD 1.4 should be upgraded to
NetBSD 1.4.2 before applying the fixes described here.

Systems running 1.4.2 should apply the following patch to
lib/libutil/passwd.c usign the patch(1), and rebuild and reinstall the
"libutil" library.  On systems which do not support shared libraries,
you should then rebuild and reinstall the "passwd" command.
